1
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,269
The train approaching platform three

2
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,310
is the 20:55 service to London Euston.

3
00:00:56,464 --> 00:01:00,323
Cover yourself up, Ella.
We're not there yet. Good girl.

4
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:03,243
Sh, sh, sh. Not our stop yet.

5
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:04,884
Back to sleep.

6
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,084
This train is about to depart.

7
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,090
Stand clear of the doors.

8
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:49,364
Stand clear of the doors.

9
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,764
Excuse me.

10
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,004
Is everything all right in there?

11
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:21,923
Sorry, madam. You wouldn't mind
looking after my kids

12
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:23,883
for a minute, would you?
I'll be right back.

13
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,381
Yeah. No problem.

14
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,204
Thank you very much. I'll be right back.

15
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,563
Suspicious in toilet C-D.

16
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:37,003
Sergeant David Budd, Metropolitan Police.

17
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:38,124
What's going on?

18
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,860
You've got an intelligence report
for an Asian male in his 20s?

19
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:44,763
How do you know about that?

20
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:46,843
I saw you checking out
the guy in my carriage.

21
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:49,283
He's fine but I saw someone
acting suspiciously at Marston.

22
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,323
I don't know if he succeeded
in boarding the train

23
00:03:51,324 --> 00:03:52,780
but, if he did,
he could be in the toilet.

24
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,563
Look, I'm an Operational
Firearms Commander

25
00:03:56,564 --> 00:03:59,364
with Specialist Protection.
What's the plan?

26
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:06,443
British Transport Police have
put out an alert on a possible

27
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:09,163
suicide bomber attempting to
board a London-bound service.

28
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:11,323
We've been ordered to stop
the train at Barnet Shed.

29
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:13,883
It's a derelict depot out in the sticks.

30
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:18,163
They're going to board the train.

31
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:19,964
How long till we get there?

32
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:23,723
- Seven minutes.
- He won't detonate in the toilet.

33
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:26,100
He'll go into the carriage
for maximum casualties.

34
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:28,700
Right, stick with me on this.
What's your name?

35
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:32,043
- Sandra.
- Give me your number.

36
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:37,323
Uh... 07700900876.

37
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:38,844
- I need to call this in.
- Do it.

38
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:57,844
This way, Sarge.
We'll take you down to track-side.

39
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:25,083
I need a few more minutes.
Is that all right?

40
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,324
- Yeah. No problem.
- Thank you.

41
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,643
- Hello?
- I can't let him get out of there.

42
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:02,267
There's dozens of
passengers on this train,

43
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,483
- my kids included.
- What?

44
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:05,723
Can you unlock the exit doors
while the train's moving?

45
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:07,444
Hello?

46
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:11,364
Shit.

47
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:14,684
Shit.

48
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:22,724
Fuck.

49
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:29,204
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

50
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:40,643
What I said is can you...?

51
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:43,203
The stop's just a few minutes away.
Let's not do anything to...

52
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,568
If he feels the train brake,
he'll know it's an unscheduled stop.

53
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,881
He'll go into the carriage and
detonate the device. No.

54
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:50,260
Can you unlock the doors while
the train's moving or not?

55
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:53,563
- Yes.
- When I say so, do it.

56
00:06:53,564 --> 00:06:55,804
- Let me take care of the rest.
- The rest of what?

57
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,960
To throw him off the train.

58
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:07,017
Stand by.

59
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:24,124
Do it now.

60
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:05,883
Subject does not appear
to be carrying a device.

61
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:08,483
He's an Asian male, late 20s,
wearing a black baseball cap,

62
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:10,643
grey T-shirt and carrying a green coat.

63
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:13,723
Advise SCO19 he's heading towards
the front of the train and does not

64
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:16,764
appear to be a threat. Repeat,
does not appear to be a threat.

65
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,900
I'm going to examine the toilet
for signs of a device.

66
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:25,483
Trojan, Control, active message.

67
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:26,643
Trojan receiving.

68
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:29,323
Subject is at front of train,
no visible device,

69
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:30,723
to be detained for questioning.

70
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:32,083
Proceed as planned.

71
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:34,963
- Copy.
- Train ETA's three minutes.

72
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:36,404
Three minutes!

73
00:08:57,324 --> 00:08:58,644
Assalaamu Alaikum.

74
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:04,764
I just want to talk.

75
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:07,684
That's all.

76
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:14,844
I can see you're as scared as I am.

77
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,804
Miss, I just want to help you.

78
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:23,604
You don't have to do this.

79
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:27,300
You can change your mind.

80
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:30,403
Don't do that! Please don't do that!
Don't move. Stay still.

81
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:34,323
Please. Just stay still.
Please! Just stay still. Don't move.

82
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,683
Please. Please!

83
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:56,244
You don't want to do this.

84
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:00,403
You don't look like you do.

85
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:03,603
Listen, the specialist
counter-terrorism unit

86
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,883
already know about a potential
incident on this train.

87
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:09,524
So what I'd like to do
is just tell them...

88
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,857
...that you're willing to talk.

89
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:16,620
Does that sound OK to you?

90
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:19,302
Just talk, is that a start?

91
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:28,683
There's a second bomber...

92
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:30,403
...but we're talking.

93
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:32,123
Now write this down.

94
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,963
Young Asian female,

95
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:36,123
equipped with an explosives vest.

96
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:39,163
Advise SCO19 she's willing to talk.

97
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:43,883
Request armed officers hold back
from boarding the train

98
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:46,163
and that bomb disposal and negotiators

99
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,443
are deployed as operational priority.

100
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:52,603
But firstly, right now,
evacuate the adjacent carriages.

101
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah. OK.

102
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:01,603
This is your guard speaking.

103
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:04,603
Would all passengers in carriage D

104
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:09,963
please make your way at once
into carriages E and F?

105
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:14,483
And would all passengers in
carriage C please make your way

106
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:17,443
- immediately into carriages B and A?
- Come on, wake up. We've got to move.

107
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,444
- Where's Daddy?
- Wake up.

108
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:21,134
I'll just have a look

109
00:11:21,135 --> 00:11:24,163
and make sure that everyone's
getting out all right. OK?

110
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:27,380
All right? I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

111
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:39,004
It's OK. It's OK.

112
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,123
My name's David.

113
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,883
David Budd.

114
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:45,124
What's yours?

115
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,204
Nadia.

116
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:57,923
The man that was in here before,

117
00:11:57,924 --> 00:12:00,124
is that your husband?

118
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:04,764
Yeah?

119
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:08,524
And your husband wants you to die?

120
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,123
You don't have to be a martyr, Nadia.

121
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:15,323
We can deactivate this device

122
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:17,403
and we can protect you from your husband.

123
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,460
You don't ever have to see him
again if you don't want to.

124
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:24,803
Hey, Nadia.

125
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,020
Nadia, look at me.

126
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,763
I'm just as scared as you are, I promise.

127
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:33,884
I'm just bringing my kids back
from visiting my mum.

128
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,643
You have children?

129
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:39,620
Yes. I do. Two.

130
00:12:42,004 --> 00:12:45,660
That's Ella. She's ten.
Charlie. He's eight.

131
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,220
I just want to take them home
to their mum.

132
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:04,363
Trojan, Control, we've got
a sit rep from the train guard.

133
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:07,203
There's an off-duty specialist
protection officer on board.

134
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,963
PS David Budd.

135
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:10,180
Received.

136
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:16,643
Stand by.

137
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:18,060
It's all right.

138
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:20,883
Everything's going to be all right.

139
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:27,843
Stop! Please! Stop!
Listen to me. Listen to me.

140
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:30,643
Why would someone you love want
you to kill yourself?

141
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,403
You've been brainwashed.

142
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:34,403
He has. You have.

143
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:36,123
And I know.

144
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:38,682
I was in Afghanistan.
I saw mates get killed.

145
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:41,043
Nearly got killed myself.
For what? Nothing.

146
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:44,003
Politicians. Cowards and liars.
Ours and theirs.

147
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:46,763
People full of talk but will never
spill a drop of their own blood.

148
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:49,923
But you and I,
we're just collateral damage.

149
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:51,980
Don't let them win, Nadia.

150
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,284
Don't let them win.

151
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:03,020
Police officer! Don't shoot!

152
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:09,723
All right? Stay right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

153
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,643
You hear that?

154
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:14,083
That's them evacuating
everyone from the train.

155
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,483
So it's just you and I.

156
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:18,120
It's just us here. OK?

157
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,843
- Armed police! Armed police!
- Get down on the ground!

158
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:26,923
Put your hands on your head
and get down! Get down!

159
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:28,620
Don't move!

160
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:37,300
Stay exactly where you are, Nadia.
Don't move, OK? All right.

161
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:39,603
Armed Police!

162
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:42,483
PS David Budd,
specialist protection! Don't shoot!

163
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:44,803
We know who you are! Stand clear!

164
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:48,163
It's all right. I'm not going anywhere.

165
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:51,843
Just stay very still now, Nadia. OK?

166
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:53,363
David, work with me, yeah?

167
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:56,683
You've done a great job
but you're not OFC here. I am.

168
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:59,963
I need you to stand down, nice and easy.

169
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,843
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here with you.

170
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:06,083
It's all right. Nothing's changed.
It's just us talking here.

171
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:10,284
- Just stay, really, really still.
- OK? Move... away... from the subject.

172
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:19,250
In position.

173
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,643
It's OK, Nadia. It's all right. It's OK.

174
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:24,883
TFC reports sniper in position.
Critical shot authorised.

175
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:26,003
Received.

176
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:28,444
Nadia, I need you to trust me.

177
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,563
I'm going to turn round
and speak to this officer.

178
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,003
She's cooperating.
She intends to surrender.

179
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:37,163
She does not intend to activate
the device. Get Expo here.

180
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:39,060
They're here. Now move away.

181
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:43,460
It's all right. It's OK.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm not.

182
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:45,483
David, stand clear.

183
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:49,083
Nadia, you need to show them you're
not going to detonate the device.

184
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,203
Now, when I ask you to,

185
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:52,643
I want you to raise your arms
either side of you.

186
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:54,003
Can you do that for me when I ask?

187
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:55,803
This is your final warning. Stand clear!

188
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:58,044
Nadia's going to spread her arms

189
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,483
and we're going to stay put
and wait for Expo.

190
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:03,363
Trojan OFC to TFC.

191
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:06,083
PS Budd has been given repeated
warnings to stand down but has

192
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:08,683
failed to cooperate. We have
no clear shot of the subject.

193
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,083
That's it, nice and slow.
Stay close to me.

194
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:13,803
Come in. Come in, close to me. That's it.

195
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,883
All right, doing really well.

196
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:18,123
Doing really well, Nadia.

197
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,323
That gun, that's an MCX carbine.

198
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,643
A bullet from that would go
through the both of us.

199
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:25,483
I'm trusting they're not going
to shoot one of their own.

200
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,140
All right? You trust me too?

201
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:30,684
OK.

202
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:33,964
Shit.

203
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,163
Shit. Oh, come on.

204
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:38,643
Control to Sniper 1.
Do you have a clean shot?

205
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:40,003
Negative.

206
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:43,683
Stay in there. Don't go out.
Stay here. Stay here with me.

207
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:46,603
Subject required out of toilet
for critical shot.

208
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:49,323
- Received.
- Get Expo here, now!

209
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:52,577
David, I need the subject
to step out of the toilet.

210
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,816
No, she's going to stay here
and wait for Expo.

211
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,003
- That's what we're going to do.
- Don't move. Come out of the toilet.

212
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:59,563
- Come out of the toilet.
- Stay really still for me, will you?

213
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,700
- That's it. You're doing really good.
- Out now, miss. Listen to me.

214
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,755
- Get Expo here.
- David, stand aside.

215
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,868
Don't fire! Do not do this!

216
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:11,723
- You need to come out of the toilet!
- Don't do this! Don't do this!

217
00:17:11,724 --> 00:17:14,083
Nadia, stay there, don't move.
Please don't move, Nadia!

218
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:16,403
- Step out of the toilet!
- Don't do this. Don't do this.

219
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:18,563
- Please don't do this.
- David, stand down! Out! OUT!

220
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:21,992
- Stay here! That's it. Don't do this!
- Get out of the fucking toilet!

221
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,200
No!

222
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:33,083
- No shot!
- All right. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

223
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:35,941
All right, Nadia. Hold tight. That's it.

224
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:38,243
Just keep moving. Hold tight.

225
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:42,420
OK. All right.

226
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:47,603
Control to Sniper 1.
Can you execute critical shot?

227
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:49,060
Negative.

228
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:51,500
That's it, Nadia.

229
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:57,023
No clean shot available.
Repeat, no clean shot available.

230
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,524
- Expo.
- Control. Sending Expo in now.

231
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:04,483
Expo is coming.

232
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,980
Thank you.

233
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:09,084
All right, Nadia. I've got you.

234
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,804
Explosives officer.

235
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:25,523
Stay calm. Stay calm.

236
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,443
Miss? My name's Karen.

237
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:31,044
Now I need you to put your arms down.

238
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,310
Good. Now turn your palms towards me...

239
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:38,144
...and do not move.

240
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:43,683
Nadia, I'm going to step to the side.

241
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:45,460
I'll be right here.

242
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:48,644
I'm moving towards you now.

243
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:53,740
Nadia, now I need to ask you...

244
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:58,044
...this object in your hand
is the initiation device?

245
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:01,163
Yes.

246
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:03,724
Does anyone else have
control of this device?

247
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:08,797
No.

248
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:13,164
Straighten your arm, please.

249
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,044
Arms up, please.

250
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:42,604
All the way up.

251
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,404
Turn around for me, please.

252
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:52,124
I'm going to remove the belt.

253
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:26,283
I need everyone out now.

254
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:27,564
Open the door.

255
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,963
I'm going to step off the train,
then ask you to follow me.

256
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:39,524
All right?

257
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:48,700
OK, nice and slowly.

258
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,244
Keep your hands where we can see them.

259
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:00,607
Stay calm.

260
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:02,606
Stay still and we'll lift
you down to the ground.

261
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:04,283
- Stay still!
- Nadia!

262
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:08,083
Don't look over there. Look down at
the ground. Down at the ground.

263
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:11,084
Go! Go! Let's go!

264
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:19,883
It's over. You're safe now.

265
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:22,540
He can't hurt you.
No-one's going to hurt you.

266
00:21:54,964 --> 00:21:56,844
Come on. Out you get.

267
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,498
- Thanks, mate.
- Oh, God.

268
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:03,403
- Mummy!
- Thank God! Come here.

269
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,940
Oh.

270
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,003
Oh, sweetheart.

271
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:11,924
Sorry. By the time
I'd given a statement, I...

272
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,616
- Love, it's all right.
- Thank you.

273
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,460
I'm fine. Look, we're all fine.

274
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:18,643
It's all right.

275
00:22:18,644 --> 00:22:21,714
Night-night, sweetheart. I love you.

276
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,403
Night-night, Charlie bear. Goodnight.

277
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:26,843
Night-night, sweetheart.

278
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:29,523
Night, big man. Night.

279
00:22:29,524 --> 00:22:31,324
- I love you.
- I love you too.

280
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:47,060
They'll be all right, love.

281
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:49,483
I should be heading off.

282
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:50,724
You don't have to.

283
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,778
You sure?

284
00:22:56,164 --> 00:22:58,004
Are you feeling OK?

285
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:11,164
Come on. Let's talk downstairs.

286
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,730
Oh, for Christ's sake, Dave.

287
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,820
Sorry.

288
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:25,323
I'm sorry. I'm a fucking idiot.

289
00:23:25,324 --> 00:23:26,844
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

290
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:43,541
Terrorists armed with a suicide vest

291
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:46,403
boarded the London-bound train
just before...

292
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:48,643
...the Prime Minister has called a
meeting of Cobra...

293
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,163
No-one was injured in the attack

294
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:52,563
on a packed train en route to
London Euston Station.

295
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,879
...and we would urge members of
the public to remain vigilant...

296
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,803
...the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre

297
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:58,403
will assess the current threat level.

298
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,763
My Government remains resolute

299
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,603
in our determination
to root out terrorism.

300
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:04,843
JTAC has the raised the threat
level from moderate to substantial.

301
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:08,043
What I'm being told is most
worrying about yesterday's incident

302
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:11,723
is the exceptionally high level of
sophistication of the explosive vest

303
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:13,643
employed by the would-be attackers.

304
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:17,163
It would appear most likely that
this is the work of a terror cell

305
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,283
and there may well be
accomplices still at large.

306
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,763
Frank Gardner, there,
our security correspondent.

307
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:24,483
- Morning, Sarge.
- Cheers, Ken.

308
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:26,963
...the level of sophistication
of the 1st of October device

309
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:30,763
and the very real concern that it
represents a new and devastating

310
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:34,883
threat to national security has led
the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre

311
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:39,243
to raise the UK's terror threat
level to substantial.

312
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,419
We're joined now by the Home Secretary,

313
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,923
the Right Honourable Julia Montague, MP.

314
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:47,643
Before we begin, Nick, I'd like
to pay tribute to the courage of

315
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:50,083
all members of the police
and security service

316
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:53,524
whose selfless actions prevented
an appalling act of terrorism.

317
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:03,963
Bit of a day yesterday.

318
00:25:03,964 --> 00:25:06,643
If you need some time off or for me
to refer you to occ health

319
00:25:06,644 --> 00:25:09,163
- for some counselling...
- I'm fine, thanks, ma'am.

320
00:25:09,164 --> 00:25:10,763
It's a miracle you're in one piece.

321
00:25:10,764 --> 00:25:12,858
We're all very lucky the
bomber changed her mind.

322
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:13,976
Hm.

323
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:17,243
Not that she's saying much.
And the husband's saying nothing.

324
00:25:17,244 --> 00:25:20,403
It seems like when the time came
she froze and the husband panicked.

325
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:21,444
Yeah.

326
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:26,163
Great job, David. A credit to the branch.

327
00:25:26,164 --> 00:25:27,660
Thank you, ma'am.

328
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:31,283
So far you've acted as PPO to
visiting foreign dignitaries?

329
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:32,683
That's right, ma'am.

330
00:25:32,684 --> 00:25:34,003
The commissioner's ordered me

331
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:37,003
to review specialist protection
on senior politicians.

332
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:39,483
I'm assigning you to a Cabinet minister.

333
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:41,323
The Home Secretary.

334
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:42,940
Very good, ma'am.

335
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,300
It's a move up.

336
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:47,324
Yes.

337
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:49,004
Thank you, ma'am.

338
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,190
Good man.

339
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:54,623
Ma'am.

340
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:39,666
_

341
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,740
_

342
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:21,044
My Glock and two magazines, please.

343
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:55,083
That's the principal now,
skipper, in the first car.

344
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:56,323
The backup's behind.

345
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:59,564
Her driver's Terry
and the PPO's PC Tom Fenton.

346
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:06,443
- Ma'am.
- Kim.

347
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:08,883
Ma'am, this is PS Budd, the new PPO.

348
00:28:08,884 --> 00:28:11,363
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
I was wondering if we could

349
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:13,923
discuss you using the underground
entrance from now on?

350
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:15,564
I'm late for a meeting.

351
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:18,577
Julia likes to be seen.

352
00:28:29,524 --> 00:28:32,203
- What's happening with Andrew Marr?
- I'll chase them today.

353
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:33,763
I thought it was all confirmed.

354
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:36,763
There's a possibility
that Number 10 want the slot.

355
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,963
And when were you planning to tell me?

356
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:41,243
I was waiting for the right moment.

357
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:42,684
You didn't find it.

358
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:51,723
Sierra Zulu 7-2 from Control.

359
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:53,563
Go ahead, Control. 7-2 over.

360
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:58,163
7-2, do you have an ETA for Tulip
to arrive at Melbourne?

361
00:28:58,164 --> 00:29:02,284
Control, traffic is heavy,
ETA 12 minutes. 7-2 over.

362
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:07,844
7-2, can you call up when
one minute away? Control out.

363
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:42,203
Rob Macdonald, special advisor
to the Home Secretary.

364
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:43,323
Leave a message.

365
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,963
Hi, it's me. We need to catch up.

366
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:47,443
Come to the flat.

367
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:50,364
Not sure what time I'll be home.
Depends on the traffic.

368
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:57,180
Cross the river and take the south circ.

369
00:29:58,084 --> 00:30:00,123
Terry's been driving me for three years.

370
00:30:00,124 --> 00:30:02,564
I think he can be trusted to
determine the fastest route.

371
00:30:03,644 --> 00:30:05,283
I've made a dynamic risk assessment

372
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:08,203
and, given the current threat level,
I'm recommending a diversion.

373
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:10,043
How much longer will that take?

374
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:12,403
Can't say for certain, ma'am.

375
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:15,403
In that case we'll just take the
usual route, please, Terry.

376
00:30:15,404 --> 00:30:17,043
Take the south circ, if you don't mind.

377
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:20,003
My job's to keep you safe, ma'am.
I won't tell you how to do yours.

378
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:22,420
No, but you're happy to make it harder.

379
00:30:34,484 --> 00:30:38,380
47-79, we'll park up across
the road and wait.

380
00:30:54,804 --> 00:30:56,084
Ma'am.

381
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:07,804
If you wouldn't mind holding
here a moment, please, ma'am.

382
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,160
Hi.

383
00:31:19,185 --> 00:31:20,483
I've just remembered I've got nothing in.

384
00:31:20,484 --> 00:31:22,042
Are you all right to pick up a takeaway?

385
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,163
Not a problem. Usual?

386
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:24,580
Sure.

387
00:31:30,124 --> 00:31:31,980
May I ask what you're doing?

388
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,083
What's behind this door?

389
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:35,923
My study.

390
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:38,763
Seriously? I'm expecting a colleague
and I need you to fuck off.

391
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:39,804
No offence.

392
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:42,571
None taken.

393
00:31:56,764 --> 00:31:59,203
That was us plotting
to build the Death Star.

394
00:31:59,204 --> 00:32:00,643
How long's this going to take?

395
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,604
Can't say for certain, ma'am.

396
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,210
Just get on with it.

397
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,603
- PC Knowles said your name's Budd.
- Yes, ma'am.

398
00:32:35,604 --> 00:32:39,030
The officer who prevented the 1st of
October rail attack. That was you?

399
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:40,158
Yes, ma'am.

400
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:43,363
It's been a long and trying day.

401
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:45,820
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

402
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:48,277
Thank you, ma'am.

403
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:52,917
All is forgiven.

404
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:55,963
As you wish, ma'am.

405
00:32:55,964 --> 00:32:58,244
No, really, I've been a total cow.

406
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:01,024
All is forgiven.

407
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:10,700
Thank you.

408
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:14,228
- Skip...
- Evening.

409
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,388
Mr Macdonald visiting the principal.

410
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,570
I can get it.

411
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,179
Oh. Hello.

412
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:41,524
Evening, sir.

413
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:43,683
Rob Macdonald.

414
00:33:43,684 --> 00:33:45,803
Perfect timing. I'm starving.
Come through.

415
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:47,163
Sergeant Budd won't be long.

416
00:33:47,164 --> 00:33:48,683
Actually, I'm all done, ma'am.

417
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:49,883
Thank you, Sergeant.

418
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:51,963
Couple of prawn crackers going
if you want some?

419
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,284
No, thank you, sir.

420
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,730
- Have a good evening, ma'am.
- You too.

421
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:02,324
I got this for later.

422
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:25,443
Evening, lads.

423
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:26,484
Skip.

424
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:34,060
Control, Sierra Zulu 7-9.
We're state 11 handing off to DPG.

425
00:35:10,244 --> 00:35:11,283
Hello.

426
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:12,460
Hiya, love.

427
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:15,683
You OK?

428
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:17,724
Yeah. I'm just calling for a chat.

429
00:35:18,964 --> 00:35:20,444
About what?

430
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:25,483
Just calling for a chat, Vic.

431
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:26,963
What do you want?

432
00:35:26,964 --> 00:35:29,483
What do I want?
I'm just calling to say hello.

433
00:35:29,484 --> 00:35:31,163
Just missed you, that's all.

434
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:32,924
SHE SIGHS Don't start.

435
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:37,700
Why can't we just have a chat
like two normal adults, Vicky?

436
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:40,180
This is not normal.

437
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:45,683
Vicky, I've put a lid on it.
I'm handling things.

438
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:49,483
I know what happens when you call
late with a few drinks inside you.

439
00:35:49,484 --> 00:35:51,083
I've not even had a few drinks.

440
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,083
Vicky.

441
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:57,563
Vicky, let's just have a chat.
Let's just have a chat!

442
00:35:57,564 --> 00:35:59,095
- Not now.
- Vic.

443
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,643
No. Not like this.

444
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:01,963
Vicky.

445
00:36:04,884 --> 00:36:06,204
Shit!

446
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:11,363
There is a heightened
police presence at airports,

447
00:36:11,364 --> 00:36:12,723
railway stations and other...

448
00:36:12,724 --> 00:36:14,630
...failed 1st of October rail
attack has triggered a hunt

449
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,563
- for accomplices. Counter-terrorism
- officers believe...

450
00:36:17,564 --> 00:36:19,283
...ignited a debate on national security,

451
00:36:19,284 --> 00:36:21,323
which has the potential to
split the Government.

452
00:36:21,324 --> 00:36:23,243
The Prime Minister,
considered a moderate...

453
00:36:23,244 --> 00:36:26,123
The Home Secretary's efforts to
enhance surveillance powers through

454
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:30,844
a new Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Bill, so-called RIPA-18...

455
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,243
Home Secretary, two minutes till
I take you through to the studio.

456
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:41,284
Thank you.

457
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:51,324
I bet the PM pulled out because he
knew you'd do a much better job.

458
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,740
Sounds like a reason NOT to pull out.

459
00:36:56,364 --> 00:36:57,723
Your decaf.

460
00:36:57,724 --> 00:36:59,843
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- Shit.

461
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:02,160
- Christ!
- Shit.

462
00:37:02,884 --> 00:37:05,883
SHE LAUGHS. I'm sorry. Shut up.

463
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:08,163
- Give her your blouse.
- It'll never fit.

464
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:10,723
- Oh, for God's sake!
- Give her yours, then.

465
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,883
I don't wear blouses, do I?

466
00:37:12,884 --> 00:37:14,723
Can we dry it out?

467
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:17,220
Don't be ridiculous. There's no time.

468
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:20,043
Fresh on this morning, ma'am.

469
00:37:20,044 --> 00:37:21,723
You've got to be kidding me.

470
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:24,083
My shirts are altered to
fit over my ballistic vest

471
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,980
so the chest-to-waist ratio
should be compatible.

472
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:29,843
Well, don't all stand around gawping.

473
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:33,060
And you, fuck off and organise
Sergeant Budd a new shirt.

474
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:38,900
You'll have to tuck it
under your jacket, ma'am.

475
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:41,097
Thank you.

476
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:47,083
Some privacy?

477
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:48,404
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

478
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:06,123
Home Secretary,

479
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:09,123
just how anxious should we be
about this terrorist threat?

480
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:11,123
Is there another one around the corner?

481
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,563
We are a target.

482
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,643
We can't be complacent.

483
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:18,443
Now, I am committed to supporting
our security services

484
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:21,923
by giving them greater powers
to confront greater threats.

485
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,803
The Government is intent on
forcing through a beefed-up

486
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:28,123
Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act this year,

487
00:38:28,124 --> 00:38:32,043
RIPA-18 as it's been dubbed,
spearheaded by you,

488
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:35,407
but critics are calling it
a snoopers' charter to monitor

489
00:38:35,408 --> 00:38:39,923
phone calls, e-mails and social
media without judicial review.

490
00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:44,323
Andrew, only those intent on acts
of violence have anything to fear.

491
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:46,803
And the Prime Minister has been
quoted as saying that,

492
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:48,283
"Lessons need to be learned

493
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,963
"from our military interventions
in the Middle East."

494
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:53,243
So what do you think
those lessons might be?

495
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:56,803
I can't see any justification
for believing the Taliban would

496
00:38:56,804 --> 00:39:00,443
govern Afghanistan in peace
and harmony, or Iraqi insurgents

497
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:03,723
would ever have formed a stable
democracy, or Isis would ever

498
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:07,043
form a state with which the world
could have diplomatic relations.

499
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:11,163
And, Andrew, I certainly do not miss
the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.

500
00:39:11,164 --> 00:39:13,523
So what are the lessons to be learned?

501
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:16,483
The Prime Minister has been
very clear on how we deal

502
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:18,963
with the present
and build a more secure future.

503
00:39:18,964 --> 00:39:22,403
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

504
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:26,243
I can't see any justification
for believing the Taliban would

505
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:29,843
govern Afghanistan in peace and
harmony, or Iraqi insurgents would

506
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:32,484
ever have formed a stable democracy or...

507
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,683
...and build a more secure future.

508
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:39,500
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

509
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:42,764
...doesn't require
apologising for the past.

510
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:47,564
That doesn't require
apologising for the past.

511
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:52,683
...doesn't require
apologising for the past.

512
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:56,963
...apologising for the past.
..apologising for the past.

513
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:58,483
...apologising for the past.

514
00:39:58,484 --> 00:40:01,363
...apologising for the past.
..apologising for the past.

515
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:04,884
..apologising for the
past... apologising for the past.

516
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:14,163
Hello. Reception. Where? Yes, here he is.

517
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:16,927
Security, they need you upstairs! Quick!

518
00:40:21,164 --> 00:40:22,620
Clear back!

519
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:46,963
How can you treat me like that?

520
00:40:46,964 --> 00:40:48,763
You have had it in for me from day one!

521
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:51,323
- Oh, stand there like a smug prat!
- Sergeant Budd, thank you.

522
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,363
Sergeant Budd, would you kindly
escort Ms Dyson from the building

523
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:57,442
and we can all get back to work?
Thank you.

524
00:40:57,443 --> 00:40:59,843
...for a job that you don't even
know what I do on a daily basis.

525
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:03,181
Have you taken the time? No.
Because you are that arrogant.

526
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:05,683
- Get back in your office! Narcissist!
- There's a cab coming for her.

527
00:41:05,684 --> 00:41:07,545
Oh, a cab! Keep your cab.

528
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,944
- You narcissistic, smug prick.
- Sorry.

529
00:41:08,945 --> 00:41:10,883
Good luck with your interview, darling!

530
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:13,163
I wouldn't work here if I'm fucking paid.

531
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:16,048
- Miss, will you come with me, please?
- No.

532
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:21,180
Come on. Let's talk about it
downstairs. All right?

533
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,700
Can you not stand so close to me, please?

534
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:41,803
Yeah, I'm just coming out
onto the street now.

535
00:41:41,804 --> 00:41:42,940
Thanks.

536
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,123
Bit calmer?

537
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:46,563
If you don't want to deal with them,

538
00:41:46,564 --> 00:41:49,203
I can sort out sending on your
personal belongings.

539
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:50,700
Thank you.

540
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:52,723
What happened?

541
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:55,643
They've started interviewing
candidates for my job.

542
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:57,843
Didn't even tell me they were
giving me the push. So...

543
00:41:57,844 --> 00:41:59,363
They didn't say why?

544
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:02,363
There's no "they".
It's just her. Sociopath.

545
00:42:02,364 --> 00:42:04,281
God help anyone who sees through her.

546
00:42:04,282 --> 00:42:05,914
I thought they were sending you a cab.

547
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:08,124
Yeah. I don't need their shitty cab.

548
00:42:25,964 --> 00:42:28,087
Sierra Zulu 7-9, Lavender inbound.

549
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,363
This is a breakdown of the
additional powers sought by RIPA-18.

550
00:42:30,364 --> 00:42:32,243
Mind if I steal your boss
for a minute, Rob?

551
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:34,708
Uh, sure. See you inside.

552
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:37,084
Interesting TV interview.
You must be very proud.

553
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:39,606
I'd like to get into the Chamber
if that's all right with you, Roger.

554
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:41,483
Planning to hijack the
counter-terror debate for a bit more

555
00:42:41,484 --> 00:42:44,163
- shameless self-promotion?
- Is there a point to this conversation?

556
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,471
- Why aren't you returning my calls?
- Pardon me, ma'am,

557
00:42:46,472 --> 00:42:48,483
for security reasons,
I'd prefer if you moved indoors.

558
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,243
You work for us, Plod,
so wind your neck in.

559
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:52,643
I'm the fucking Chief Whip
and when I call, you answer.

560
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:55,123
We claim the centre ground
but you're heading off-piste.

561
00:42:55,124 --> 00:42:57,470
The PM can count on my full support.

562
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:00,603
Bullshit. He's weakened. You're making
a move for the leadership.

563
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:02,883
Sir, ma'am, I really do
need you both to move inside.

564
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:05,844
Can't you call your monkey off?
Throw him some nuts.

565
00:43:06,144 --> 00:43:07,584
I'm mixed-race.

566
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,763
- Hi.
- John. Roger Penhaligon.

567
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,643
- You OK?
- No. Not great.

568
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:26,243
I need to record my side of
a conversation with one of the PPOs.

569
00:43:26,244 --> 00:43:29,163
Are you? Biracial?

570
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:30,460
No, ma'am.

571
00:43:32,564 --> 00:43:34,683
Right, where were we?

572
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:36,283
Right. This is a summary

573
00:43:36,284 --> 00:43:39,484
of the limitations
in existing legislation...

574
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:57,564
All clear, ma'am.

575
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:03,737
Sergeant Budd.

576
00:44:14,044 --> 00:44:15,460
Your shirt.

577
00:44:16,284 --> 00:44:17,860
Thank you, ma'am.

578
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:22,043
I'm sorry about Chanel. She took
her dismissal badly and my staff

579
00:44:22,044 --> 00:44:24,924
thought you'd be the best
person to deal with it.

580
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,444
If you can talk someone out of
blowing up a train...

581
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:34,843
Want one?

582
00:44:34,844 --> 00:44:36,443
On duty, ma'am.

583
00:44:36,444 --> 00:44:38,243
Soft drinks in the fridge.

584
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:40,100
No... thank you, ma'am.

585
00:44:40,964 --> 00:44:42,923
Do you prefer David or Dave?

586
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:44,244
I answer to both, ma'am.

587
00:44:50,364 --> 00:44:52,342
You won't have heard yet

588
00:44:52,343 --> 00:44:55,323
but we are going to charge
the male 1st of October attacker.

589
00:44:55,324 --> 00:44:58,483
He appears to have plausible links
to Islamist terrorists,

590
00:44:58,484 --> 00:45:01,083
though I'm not at liberty
to say more at this stage.

591
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:02,723
That's good news. Thanks, ma'am.

592
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:06,803
And thanks to you, his wife's alive
to assist with our inquiries.

593
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,883
It seems I'm constantly finding
reasons to compliment you.

594
00:45:09,884 --> 00:45:11,740
Not quite constantly.

595
00:45:14,724 --> 00:45:16,500
Is there a Mrs Budd?

596
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:19,563
Yes, ma'am. Vicky. We have two children.

597
00:45:19,564 --> 00:45:20,780
What are their names?

598
00:45:21,284 --> 00:45:23,060
Ella and Charlie.

599
00:45:24,484 --> 00:45:27,220
Your shifts must make
home life difficult.

600
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:31,883
I'm sorry. That was private.
I shouldn't have.

601
00:45:31,884 --> 00:45:36,340
No, it's... You'd know, ma'am,
all these hours you work.

602
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:39,631
Goes with the territory.

603
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:43,660
Did you always want to be a politician?

604
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:45,900
I hope you don't mind me asking that.

605
00:45:47,004 --> 00:45:49,163
I was a criminal barrister.

606
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:52,403
I witnessed at first hand how
the causes of crime often

607
00:45:52,404 --> 00:45:56,963
have as much to do with a person's
upbringing and social circumstances.

608
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:59,804
I sought a role in which
I could make a real difference.

609
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:05,924
I'm keeping you.

610
00:46:08,857 --> 00:46:10,260
May I ask, ma'am...

611
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,940
...that interview you did on telly,
did you mean what you said?

612
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,244
I'm sorry?

613
00:46:18,584 --> 00:46:20,304
About the Middle East.

614
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,460
See, I don't say only what
the people want to hear.

615
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:30,300
I'm about doing the right thing
and making the hard choices.

616
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:34,524
The thing is, David/Dave,
I don't need you to vote for me,

617
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,190
only to protect me.

618
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:40,524
Rest assured, ma'am.

619
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,298
I'll do what's required.

620
00:46:48,184 --> 00:46:49,624
Ma'am.

621
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:06,324
Skipper.

622
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,923
Sorry, I was just getting ready for work.

623
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:14,820
I just wanted to apologise for
the other night.

624
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:17,300
OK.

625
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:21,923
I was just having a couple of rounds
of toast but I can make you some.

626
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:23,644
You're all right, love. I'm fine.

627
00:48:24,844 --> 00:48:26,164
The kids not up yet?

628
00:48:28,324 --> 00:48:30,404
They're all right, aren't they?

629
00:48:30,884 --> 00:48:32,084
Sleepover.

630
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,603
Both of them?

631
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:38,660
RIPA-18 will give them that support.

632
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,304
Vic?

633
00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:45,163
Look, don't take this the wrong way.

634
00:48:45,164 --> 00:48:48,403
I know you're disappointed
to miss the kids, but...

635
00:48:48,404 --> 00:48:50,363
...maybe that's why it's best
that you call ahead

636
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:51,724
if you're going to come round.

637
00:48:57,624 --> 00:48:59,184
I was hoping we could talk.

638
00:49:00,964 --> 00:49:03,243
- Why?
- I've said I'm sorry.

639
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:04,604
Yeah, you always are.

640
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,283
You need help, Dave.

641
00:49:08,284 --> 00:49:10,923
I need a job that pays the bills, Vic.

642
00:49:10,924 --> 00:49:13,363
Yes. And I keep covering for you
so that you can keep it

643
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:16,260
but I've stopped being able
to stand back and watch.

644
00:49:17,044 --> 00:49:18,443
You are getting worse, Dave.

645
00:49:18,444 --> 00:49:21,020
Love, I'm sorry,
but we can work through this.

646
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:25,671
I've met someone.

647
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:31,884
He was here?

648
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:34,777
Overnight?

649
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:37,364
Yes.

650
00:49:39,084 --> 00:49:41,043
- Still here?
- No.

651
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,923
Look, I... I was going to tell you.

652
00:49:43,924 --> 00:49:46,723
You farm our kids out so you can
have your night together?

653
00:49:46,724 --> 00:49:49,843
They're with their school friends.
They've had a lovely time.

654
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:51,043
Do they know?

655
00:49:51,044 --> 00:49:52,643
They think that he's a friend.

656
00:49:52,644 --> 00:49:53,684
Oh.

657
00:49:55,604 --> 00:49:56,884
Dave...

658
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,850
Dave?

659
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:10,163
Let's not get divorced yet.

660
00:50:10,164 --> 00:50:14,300
Oh, God, no. We're not that serious
or anything. It's early days.

661
00:50:16,364 --> 00:50:18,324
In case anything happens to me at work...

662
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:22,771
...you'll still get the pension
if we're legally married.

663
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:36,843
That the Counter-Terrorism
and Security Act 2015

664
00:50:36,844 --> 00:50:39,580
simply does not go far enough.

665
00:50:40,724 --> 00:50:41,923
Hi. Chanel.

666
00:50:41,924 --> 00:50:43,580
Yeah, sorry.

667
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:45,883
I hope here's OK.

668
00:50:45,884 --> 00:50:47,803
Oh, fine. Can I get you anything?

669
00:50:47,804 --> 00:50:50,164
- No, please, let me.
- Maybe later.

670
00:50:52,244 --> 00:50:55,057
Look, I know, but you
just always seemed open

671
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:56,643
to the wider possibilities of a story,

672
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:58,763
not one to regurgitate the press release.

673
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,083
Thanks very much.

674
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:01,963
And for getting in touch.

675
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:03,763
Julia Montague's the woman of the hour,

676
00:51:03,764 --> 00:51:05,643
so my editor didn't take much persuading.

677
00:51:05,644 --> 00:51:08,363
"Woman of the hour."
Talk about an understatement.

678
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,603
You weren't able to give me much
detail over the phone.

679
00:51:10,604 --> 00:51:12,580
Yeah, that's right. Well...

680
00:51:13,164 --> 00:51:15,563
...I just want to stop everyone
getting carried away

681
00:51:15,564 --> 00:51:18,083
with this idea that she's
such a brilliant politician.

682
00:51:18,084 --> 00:51:20,780
- How would you describe her?
- A sociopath.

683
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,683
The most dangerous person in the country.

684
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,003
More dangerous than the people

685
00:51:25,004 --> 00:51:26,883
that she keeps calling
enemies of freedom.

686
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:29,643
- How's she dangerous?
- She's got an agenda.

687
00:51:29,644 --> 00:51:34,380
To heighten fear, to destroy
debate and to seize power.

688
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:37,443
What evidence do you have to
substantiate these claims?

689
00:51:37,444 --> 00:51:39,683
I've worked for two years
in the Home Office,

690
00:51:39,684 --> 00:51:42,860
most of that time in daily contact
with Julia Montague.

691
00:51:44,857 --> 00:51:46,697
You were fired, Chanel.

692
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:49,124
Yeah.

693
00:51:50,244 --> 00:51:52,163
In Whitehall, this isn't a story,

694
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:54,803
"Aide gets fired.
Aide bad-mouths minister."

695
00:51:54,804 --> 00:51:57,388
I'm trying to explain
how Julia's different.

696
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:59,083
But you're not explaining
how you're different

697
00:51:59,084 --> 00:52:01,300
from any other disgruntled
former employee.

698
00:52:01,964 --> 00:52:05,323
You've got my number and e-mail
if you find something concrete.

699
00:52:05,324 --> 00:52:07,084
I hope things work out for you.

700
00:52:26,724 --> 00:52:30,403
Are you getting in?
Do you want me to call someone?

701
00:52:30,404 --> 00:52:32,723
That's the last thing I want you to do.

702
00:52:32,724 --> 00:52:33,964
Open invitation.

703
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:04,203
For decades, the West

704
00:53:04,204 --> 00:53:07,683
has been inflicting suffering
on the poor and powerless.

705
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:11,660
The war in the desert, in the oil fields,

706
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:15,443
we've brought it back
to the streets of Britain.

707
00:53:15,444 --> 00:53:17,723
There's kids growing up over here,

708
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:22,083
all they hear is what's been done
to families and friends over there.

709
00:53:22,084 --> 00:53:25,980
Who can blame them
if they want to push back?

710
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,763
And when they push back,

711
00:53:35,764 --> 00:53:39,404
our politicians act
like it's come from nowhere,

712
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,363
so they can pass laws
restricting our freedoms

713
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:45,523
and order new attacks against
the so-called terrorists,

714
00:53:45,524 --> 00:53:50,020
and guess what?
The cycle of violence goes on.

715
00:53:52,004 --> 00:53:54,900
Always wondered if
you'd turn up some time.

716
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:57,620
Soapbox is not really my thing, mate.

717
00:53:58,084 --> 00:54:00,060
That's not how you were in Helmand.

718
00:54:00,644 --> 00:54:02,780
That was a crazy time out there.

719
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:04,883
I'm trying to put all that behind me.

720
00:54:04,884 --> 00:54:07,020
I'm making a proper go of civvy street.

721
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:13,140
Put PTSD on your job application,
who's going to hire you, right?

722
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,820
Just because it's not visible...

723
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,443
Mate, you can't beat it on your own.

724
00:54:23,444 --> 00:54:25,380
The counselling sessions,

725
00:54:26,084 --> 00:54:28,540
they're really helpful.

726
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:32,084
- There's a bunch of us now, good...
- I'm good, thanks.

727
00:54:38,284 --> 00:54:40,444
So what are you doing now?

728
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,830
Police.

729
00:54:44,444 --> 00:54:45,780
Doing what?

730
00:54:46,404 --> 00:54:47,683
Specialist protection.

731
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:51,363
Government ministers.
Are you fucking kidding me?

732
00:54:51,364 --> 00:54:53,684
You're protecting those wankers?

733
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:57,483
You turn up after all this time
and tell me this shit?

734
00:54:57,484 --> 00:55:00,820
What's that about?
You've got a fucking nerve, mate.

735
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:04,900
- I knew you'd understand.
- Understand what?

736
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:07,763
You said it out in Helmand.

737
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:08,923
You say a lot of stuff

738
00:55:08,924 --> 00:55:11,180
when you've seen your
best mates blown to pieces.

739
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,323
That if you ever found yourself
right beside one of those bastards

740
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:16,603
that sent us out there,

741
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,964
you'd just close your eyes
and pull the trigger.

742
00:55:20,564 --> 00:55:22,243
You'd still have a face.

743
00:55:22,244 --> 00:55:23,884
I'd still have a family.

744
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,164
Doors and seat belts.

745
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:13,803
Little bird told me

746
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:16,420
you were Johnny on the spot
at the 1st of October?

747
00:56:17,324 --> 00:56:18,763
Yes, sir.

748
00:56:18,764 --> 00:56:21,884
Looks like the Home Secretary
couldn't be in safer hands.

749
00:56:37,684 --> 00:56:39,364
Lavender outbound.

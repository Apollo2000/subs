1
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:10,085
Looking good, Dino.

2
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:15,524
What's up, Dino?

3
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:16,825
What's up, man?

4
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:18,627
Hey, Dino.

5
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:20,929
I'm going to the restroom. Be right back.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,574
Pulp.

7
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:34,209
Pulp?

8
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:36,011
What the hell is pulp?

9
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:38,013
Find out.

10
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:40,082
In here.

11
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:46,822
Who are you supposed to be?

12
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:50,098
- Michael Caine.
- Who?

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,427
Guess you've never seen Dressed to Kill.

14
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,564
Sorry, I don't do needles.

15
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,699
This doesn't go into your vein.

16
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:59,301
It's like a B12 shot,

17
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:01,770
only much, much better.

18
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:17,752
How much?

19
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:19,921
First one's on me.

20
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:49,918
I'm not much for religion, Dino...

21
00:01:51,522 --> 00:01:53,555
but I do like what the Bible says

22
00:01:53,557 --> 00:01:55,290
about right and wrong.

23
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:57,753
You're a sinner.

24
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:00,629
Get ready. This is going to sting.

25
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:15,944
Welcome to Abnormal Behavioral Analysis,

26
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:19,447
more commonly referred to
as Intro to Psychopaths.

27
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,049
My name is Professor Dylan Reinhart,

28
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:24,786
and, yes, my mother was
a huge Bob Dylan fan.

29
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,321
Okay.

30
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,924
Can I have a volunteer?

31
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:30,926
You,

32
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:32,694
the scaredlooking one.

33
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,062
Yes, you. Come on up here.

34
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:36,965
Now!

35
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:49,678
Excuse me. Smiley face emoji.

36
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:53,848
- What's your name?
- Edward.

37
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,116
Okay, Edward,

38
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:57,118
I will give you an "A" in this course

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,055
if you punch me as hard
as you can in my stomach.

40
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:03,333
Come on.

41
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,260
What if I was to tell Edward

42
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:07,829
I would fail him if he didn't punch me?

43
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:09,264
Would that change anything?

44
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,486
- No.
- No? Well,

45
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,669
what if I was to give Edward this bag...

46
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,472
filled with a million dollars...

47
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,875
and said he could keep it if he hits me.

48
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:22,477
What would he do now?

49
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,480
- Smack him.
- If he doesn't do it, I will.

50
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,649
Exactly. So what does this tell us

51
00:03:27,651 --> 00:03:29,851
about human behavior?

52
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,420
It's contextdriven.

53
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,489
Meaning, depending on the circumstances,

54
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:37,559
we can be motivated
to do almost anything.

55
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:41,730
And I have just offered Edward
a million new circumstances.

56
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:43,498
Come on, Edward,

57
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,433
you know you wanna.

58
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,773
Normal behavior, therefore,
is when we collectively decide

59
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:55,343
that the circumstances
justify the behavior.

60
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:58,346
Abnormal behavior is when we don't.

61
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,151
But can we really judge behavior
simply on the behavior itself?

62
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:08,123
Aren't we all...
capable of behaving abnormally?

63
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:13,728
Welcome to Abnormal Behavior.

64
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,764
Wow.

65
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,905
While I may not be up on all
the laws in Pennsylvania,

66
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:26,041
I'm pretty sure punching
a student isn't legal.

67
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,576
That student isn't in my class.

68
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:30,312
He's a drama major.

69
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:32,113
And I didn't touch him.

70
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:34,149
It was a performance to prove a point.

71
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:35,684
Given that you're a detective,

72
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:37,619
you should have figured that out.

73
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:40,507
- How did...
- Come on.

74
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,265
The "I don't care how I look" pantsuit,

75
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,223
the humdrum flats,
the almost total absence

76
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,125
of makeup, and the slight dip

77
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,561
in your posture favoring your right side,

78
00:04:48,563 --> 00:04:52,699
probably due to the SIG P226
holstered to your hip.

79
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:01,908
Detective Elizabeth Needham, NYPD.

80
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,243
- You look different from your picture.
- What picture?

81
00:05:04,245 --> 00:05:06,779
The one in People magazine
from a couple of years ago.

82
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:08,014
Being one of their 25.

83
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,816
Most Intriguing People.

84
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:11,884
Must have Photoshopped it. A lot.

85
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13,753
I'd like to talk with you.

86
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:16,556
Well, I need lunch and I have a
meeting, so how about tomorrow?

87
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:18,927
I think someone may want
to kill you, so you tell me.

88
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:22,528
So, Dr. Dylan Reinhart.

89
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,696
Penn undergrad.

90
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,897
PhD in psychology,

91
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,232
Stanford.

92
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:27,803
Threeyear research fellowship,

93
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:28,883
University of Cambridge.

94
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,125
Then another PhD,

95
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:32,144
this time from MIT, statistics.

96
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:33,557
Taught at the American University

97
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,644
in Cairo...

98
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,664
Does my looking into your
background bother you?

99
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,900
What bothers me
is that you haven't yet said

100
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,068
who wants to kill me.

101
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:42,953
Dino Moretti, a 22yearold,

102
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:44,273
was found dead in a nightclub

103
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:46,197
in the Meatpacking District
from a massive heart attack

104
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,254
and all the telltale signs of a drug OD.

105
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:50,243
"Selfinflicted" may have been the report

106
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:53,141
were it not for a
playing card by his foot.

107
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:55,795
The jack of diamonds.
We have no leads, no witnesses,

108
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:57,630
and, while it may be a random killing,

109
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:59,599
I have a feeling
there'll be more murders.

110
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,167
Which is why I'm here.

111
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,269
Before Dino died,

112
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:05,805
the killer sent your book
to the Homicide Division.

113
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:07,306
As the famous expert

114
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:09,041
on criminal psychopathology,

115
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:10,645
I was hoping you might have some ideas.

116
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,992
Don't they call you Professor Psychopath?

117
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:16,582
While I may have a fascination with
psychopaths, it does not mean I am one.

118
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,118
Judging by the way you eat
your pizza, I'm not so sure.

119
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,220
Using a fork and knife
slows the process down

120
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:23,589
and allows you to focus more
on the pizza itself.

121
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,292
- I have no problem focusing on pizza.
- You should try it sometime.

122
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:28,728
Sure, right after
I catch whoever killed this kid.

123
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,063
Inside of your book,

124
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:32,665
there was also a bookmark.

125
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,318
The Master of High Knowledge Card.

126
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,989
In cartomancy the king of clubs is
said to be one who has great power

127
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:39,495
but one who is not aware of this.

128
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:42,341
Your bestselling criminal theory
book is about playing cards.

129
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:43,447
This killer is using them.

130
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,667
My book is not about playing cards.

131
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,713
Gambling was the central motif.

132
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,319
The compulsion for risk
versus the need for control,

133
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:52,505
two competing ideas which
serial killers and psychopaths

134
00:06:52,507 --> 00:06:54,654
share with us all.

135
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:57,356
- When did my book and this arrive?
- We got your book

136
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,425
- the day before Dino was killed.
- So the king of clubs

137
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:00,960
arrives the day before the kid's killed,

138
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,296
and the jack of diamonds
is left at the kid's feet

139
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,031
at the scene of the crime?

140
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,933
I think you may be right.

141
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:09,830
I think the killer is trying
to talk back to my book.

142
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,165
Or to me.

143
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,807
We're hoping your expertise
can help us figure out

144
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,209
who the killer is
and how your book connects

145
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,745
before anyone else gets hurt,
including you.

146
00:07:19,747 --> 00:07:21,186
I'm meeting this afternoon

147
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:23,705
with the victim's father, Aldo Moretti.

148
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:27,119
- Restauranteur?
- Yes. If you'd like to join me...

149
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,024
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:36,095
I have a meeting with my editor
about my next book.

151
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:39,398
Right. Those who can't do.

152
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,067
Professor.

153
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,269
Hey, maybe you can write

154
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:45,615
a book about it while the
next victim gets killed.

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,314
That thing about
not hitting the student,

156
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:50,409
that stays between us.

157
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:15,034
You look fat.

158
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,402
Nice to see you, too.

159
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:18,637
And this is flat.

160
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
Very theoretical.

161
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,171
I am discussing theories.

162
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:24,276
And I am falling asleep.

163
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:26,712
Where's the pizzazz? Where's the heart?

164
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,382
You know, your last book was alive.

165
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,450
You made being a freak cool.

166
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:34,555
You could still be the
next Malcolm Gladwell.

167
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,640
But fatter.

168
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:37,516
You used to be a man of action, and...

169
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,564
now I guess you're just...
tweed jacket guy.

170
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:41,869
I mean, come on,

171
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:44,163
you need to take a break from teaching.

172
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:47,566
You need to focus on getting
yourself and this book

173
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:52,304
into better shape, because
I need Dangerous Dylan back.

174
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:54,440
I need Sexy Dylan.

175
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,375
Look, bring this guy back.

176
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:59,345
The guy who wrote Freaks was hot.

177
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:00,780
It's funny you should say that.

178
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:02,581
A cop came to my class today.

179
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,818
A kid was killed, and, the
killer sent my book as a clue.

180
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,386
She wants my help.

181
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:08,954
That's great news!

182
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:11,557
Not the "dead kid" part...
the part where you're

183
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,826
gonna do something
to help get your mojo back.

184
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:16,289
My mojo retired to Boca.

185
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:19,932
When you finished that first book...

186
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:23,602
you had just left your other life.

187
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:27,006
And I don't think that kind of mojo

188
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:30,176
goes away after just three years.

189
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,645
I think it's still there in you.

190
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,048
And if you lose a little weight,
you might find it.

191
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:38,984
You know I made a promise.

192
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:41,187
I know you signed a twobook deal,

193
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:44,390
which is technically more
binding than a spousal promise.

194
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,258
Try telling Andy that.

195
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,962
Andy doesn't not want you doing
what you're born to do.

196
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,731
What kind of life, or book, is that?

197
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,471
Mr. Moretti,

198
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,542
was your son dealing?

199
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:03,375
Dino didn't deal.

200
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:04,243
Okay.

201
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:06,745
He is... was a bright kid.

202
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:08,114
Straight As.

203
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:09,647
And is there anybody
that you can think of

204
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:10,961
who may have held a grudge?

205
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,329
No. Everyone loved Dino.

206
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:15,465
Well, not everyone.

207
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,135
Mr. Moretti,
this is Dr. Reinhart. He's...

208
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,965
working with me on the case.

209
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,822
Dr. Reinhart, do you think
my son was murdered?

210
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,543
- Mr. Moretti.
- We're considering all possibilities

211
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,310
as we await the toxicology report.

212
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:30,447
Mr. Moretti, I don't know
if your son knew the killer,

213
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,115
but I am certain the killer
knew your son.

214
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:34,617
We're not sure there is a killer,

215
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:36,019
or that he knew your son.

216
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:37,620
Detective Needham and I
agree to disagree.

217
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:39,589
Mr. Moretti, am I right in assuming

218
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:41,224
your son didn't just
patronize White Lines,

219
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:42,392
but many other clubs?

220
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:44,527
All the clubs courted Dino.

221
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:46,362
He was treated like royalty.

222
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,264
All over the city.

223
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,966
From now on, you
don't float your theories

224
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:52,268
to anyone but me. Got it?

225
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,070
Anyone tell you you're bossy?

226
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,106
I'm not bossy, I'm your boss.

227
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:58,074
You can't tell a grieving father

228
00:10:58,076 --> 00:10:59,709
you're certain of
something if you're not.

229
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,711
Moretti said Dino was like
royalty in the clubs.

230
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,213
The king of clubs.

231
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:06,382
That playing card the killer
sent in my book was a clue

232
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:08,618
as to who's next on his list.
The jack of diamonds is, too.

233
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,986
He's our next victim.

234
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:13,089
Now we just have to figure
out who the jack is.

235
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:14,299
I...

236
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,493
It's okay.

237
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:18,661
You don't have to admit I was right.

238
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:21,765
By the way, Moretti's
never heard of your book.

239
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,433
His loss; Hope you told him so.

240
00:11:23,435 --> 00:11:24,701
I never read it either.

241
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,002
My boss made me reach out to you.

242
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:27,804
Expect a signed copy for Christmas.

243
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:29,005
Can't wait.

244
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,441
I'm gonna get a list of everyone who went

245
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:33,343
into the club the night Dino was killed.

246
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:34,778
Maybe it'll point us to who the jack is

247
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,312
before the killer gets to him.

248
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:37,747
Where's your partner?

249
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:39,269
Aren't you supposed to have a partner?

250
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:41,751
I have a bad history with partners.

251
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:42,786
Meaning...?

252
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,721
The last one nearly lost a tooth

253
00:11:44,723 --> 00:11:47,440
after he tried to stick
his tongue down my throat.

254
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,493
What made you change your mind
and show up?

255
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:53,429
If I told you that,
I wouldn't be intriguing.

256
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,444
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hello, Candice.

257
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:09,979
Take one of these.

258
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:11,506
Thank you.

259
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,584
Aloha.

260
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:18,721
Hawaiian night?

261
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:20,023
You quit a corporate law firm

262
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,758
to open your own bar for Hawaiian night?

263
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,526
It's the, it's the big college bowl game

264
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:24,861
in Honolulu.

265
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:26,262
Whatever. The place is packed. Shut up.

266
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:28,198
So it is. What do I know?

267
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:30,433
- You okay?
- Yeah.

268
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:31,835
How was your day?

269
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:34,804
You know. Humdrum life of academia.

270
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,442
Do you think of me as a professor?

271
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,445
Yeah. Well, thatthat is what you do.

272
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:43,680
That is not what I asked.

273
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:45,548
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

274
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,518
Do not have an existential
crisis on Hawaiian night.

275
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,186
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

276
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:51,721
But do you think I've put on weight?

277
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:54,457
Everyone puts on weight
after they get married.

278
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,260
- You haven't.
- We've been married less than a year.

279
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:59,162
Give me time. What's really going on?

280
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:00,997
Nothing, nothing.

281
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,432
Joan hates my new book.

282
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:03,967
She thinks it's flat and heartless.

283
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:06,536
Oof. I'm sorry.

284
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:10,273
Double Dark and Stormy coming up.

285
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,767
Thank you.

286
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,736
Follow me, and it's pretty bad.

287
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,073
You have to really dislike someone

288
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:45,408
to stab them this many times.

289
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,344
John Condon. His wife found
him about 30 minutes ago.

290
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,179
Says she was having drinks with friends.

291
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:51,681
Condon ran a Ponzi scheme.

292
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:53,249
Some business based on a spiritual quest.

293
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,051
I think the name of his company was...

294
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:56,586
Hourglass.

295
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,290
And he is definitely
our jack of diamonds.

296
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,092
- Based on what?
- May I?

297
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:06,596
Please.

298
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,565
When two diamonds are placed together

299
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:13,136
to form a shape of an hourglass,

300
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:14,804
the resulting symbol can be identified

301
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:17,907
as a depiction of enlightenment
and ultimate truth.

302
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:21,010
Though it would seem Condon's
spiritual quest was money.

303
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:24,147
And his friends called him Jack.

304
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:26,716
So you were right.

305
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:28,251
The killer is announcing
who his next victim is

306
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:30,086
with each card.

307
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:33,056
He sends us a clue about Dino
with a king,

308
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:35,158
leaves a clue about Condon with a jack,

309
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,911
and now a clue with a two
of hearts about who's next.

310
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,963
And we get to unravel the mystery.

311
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:42,526
Figure out the rules of his game.

Being called in front of the mayor,

314
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,878
especially this mayor, not exactly

315
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,813
on my day's bucket list.

316
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:06,082
I know and I apologize,
Lieutenant Gooden.

317
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,552
Seriously?

318
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:12,603
Youngest lieutenant in
the department's history?

319
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:16,692
Jasmine. Okay, Jas.

320
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:20,396
Despite my promotion,
we're friends, first.

321
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:22,498
At least, you know, when we're alone.

322
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,401
Speaking of which,
where is Professor Psycho?

323
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:28,871
Dr. Reinhart should be here any minute.

324
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:30,673
You sure you can handle this case?

325
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:32,908
I can give you a list
of the ways I'm sure.

326
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,410
Yeah, and I can give you a list
of all the guys you refuse

327
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:37,013
Sumner, Miller, Gomez...

328
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:38,914
Lazy, stupid, smug.

329
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,583
Is it possible that it's you?

330
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:44,553
Lizzie, you know, this
isn't a detective buffet.

331
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,889
You don't get to pick
the partner you want.

332
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,559
You know my heart breaks for you.

333
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,662
You've had a big setback,

334
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,330
but if you can't bounce back
in your personal life,

335
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:56,032
you got to do it here.

336
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:00,536
Lieutenant Gooden,

337
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:02,672
- Dr. Dylan Reinhart.
- Pleasure.

338
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,073
One more question, please,
JASMINE: Here we go.

339
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:06,509
- Before you go...
- Don't speak unless spoken to.

340
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,729
- Dr. Reinhart.
- Madam Mayor.

341
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:14,150
Let me tell you there will not
be a serial killer in my city.

342
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:16,552
Detective Needham and I were
just saying the same thing.

343
00:16:16,554 --> 00:16:18,097
Wait. What? Is this like

344
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:20,089
if we say it often enough
it will be true?

345
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,657
Because...

346
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:24,660
there is a serial killer in your city.

347
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:26,796
Dr. Reinhart, I'm a big fan of your work

348
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:28,664
and your belief in the power of symbols.

349
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,400
Now, given the killer's copycat
use of the playing card,

350
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:34,370
- which is the structure of your book...
- Motif.

351
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,739
I know you can help us solve this case,

352
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:40,042
protect the innocent,
and catch this butcher.

353
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:41,444
Well, nothing would please me more.

354
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:43,312
And, I know that Lizzie,

355
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,748
um, DDetective Needham and I

356
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,084
will, get him.

357
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,912
Right, Lizzie?

358
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,922
Detective, at a loss for words?

359
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:56,447
Madam Mayor,

360
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,635
the tox confirmed the club kid OD'd

361
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:00,235
on whatever the killer gave him,

362
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,631
but the track mark in
his arm wasn't in a vein.

363
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,600
The medical examiner said that

364
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:05,968
other then the needle mark in Dino's arm,

365
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,303
the only unusual thing he found

366
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:10,106
was a minor contusion in his left eye.

367
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:12,241
- Now, we're checking to see if...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

368
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:14,110
Wait a minute.

369
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,891
The eye... An eye for an eye.

370
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:19,014
I'm not following.

371
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,550
Revenge. We should check Dino's eye

372
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:23,152
to see if that's how
the OD was administered.

373
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,487
We are going to do that.

374
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,171
When heroin addicts

375
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,290
run out of veins, they sometimes

376
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,503
inject the needle into
their eye for a hit.

377
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:33,867
So if the suspect killed Dino for revenge

378
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:35,825
and also Condon for revenge...

379
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,894
Then we have a possible motive
that connects both murders

380
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:39,929
and we're one step closer
to solving the case

381
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:44,213
and not having a serial killer
in your city.

382
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:47,836
Have the M.E. check his eye.

383
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:50,373
And all of you,
just keep your mouths shut.

384
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,680
Yes, Your Honor.

385
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:56,846
Lizzie, go do what you do.

386
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:01,659
What is it about floating
theories you don't understand?

387
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:02,952
Boy.

388
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:07,123
Detective, where are we going?

389
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:09,258
Hey. Hey. If we're gonna work together,

390
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,193
I would like to have a gun.

391
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,168
The kid's eye contusion was caused by

392
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,904
an injection into the soft
tissue of the eye socket.

393
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:24,106
And this dude...

394
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:27,538
died from multiple stab wounds.

395
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,544
How many?

396
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:30,145
Way too many to count.

397
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:33,482
Yes, because counting
can get exhausting.

398
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:36,151
352. That's how many dimples there are

399
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:38,053
in a Titleist Pro V1 golf ball.

400
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:40,256
4,608... that's the number of
words in the U.S. Constitution.

401
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:42,758
Seven and a half million...
that's how many Americans

402
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,193
are currently out of work.

403
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,028
Care to add one to that number?

404
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,764
I'll call you when I'm done.

405
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:50,532
We'll wait.

406
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:53,302
So, what is it with all these facts?

407
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:55,037
You're like a walking Wikipedia.

408
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,106
I can't help it.
I have a phonographic memory.

409
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:58,274
You mean "photographic."

410
00:18:58,276 --> 00:18:59,608
No, no.

411
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,277
When I read something,
it stays in my mind,

412
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,445
but I don't see it, I hhear it.

413
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:07,283
Growing up I was a prodigy on the piano.

414
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:09,652
Chopin, Mozart.

415
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:13,188
If I heard it once,
I could play it or sing it.

416
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,323
I have perfect pitch.

417
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:15,658
I can tell if you blow your nose in "G,"

418
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,892
or the wind whistles in "D."

419
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,196
I didn't have too many friends.

420
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:22,831
No.

421
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,566
You still play?

422
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,669
Not so much.

423
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:28,637
Why did you stop?

424
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,588
52 stab wounds.

425
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:33,819
52, like a deck of cards.

426
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,412
He's deliberate, brutal...

427
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:38,647
fascinating.

428
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,849
And he has 49 cards left in his deck.

429
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:42,484
That's 49 more bodies

430
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:45,354
and a lot more carnage
if we're not careful.

431
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:56,718
Every worthwhile serial killer
has a nickname.

432
00:19:57,258 --> 00:19:59,292
You okay if we call our guy the Dealer?

433
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:00,721
I couldn't care less what we call him,

434
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:01,970
as long as we catch him

435
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:03,538
before he gets to the two of hearts.

436
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,810
So, Dino and Condon aren't friends.

437
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:11,201
They're not related. Nothing
suggests they ever met.

438
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:14,140
Revenge alone isn't gonna help
us find the two of hearts.

439
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:16,692
Two of hearts is known as
the "sweetheart card."

440
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:19,311
It represents people who love love.

441
00:20:19,312 --> 00:20:20,878
Idealists.

442
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
Of course, they're usually the people

443
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:23,848
who get hit the hardest when real life

444
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,751
comes crashing down
on their ideals, so...

445
00:20:27,754 --> 00:20:29,954
young couple who just got married?

446
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:31,155
Or divorced.

447
00:20:31,157 --> 00:20:32,423
A matchmaker?

448
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:33,875
Or a marriage counselor.

449
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,927
You're a real romantic.

450
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:37,955
Your boyfriend must be a lucky guy.

451
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:39,864
Can you stop that?

452
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:46,638
So, if your theory
about revenge is right,

453
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,858
what is the Dealer avenging?

454
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,575
Well, almost every serial killer

455
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:52,393
chooses his victims in one of two ways:

456
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,812
Randomly or very, very carefully.

457
00:20:54,814 --> 00:20:56,353
If the victims are unrelated,

458
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,950
it becomes more about
the act itself, killing.

459
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:00,685
If the victims are related, it becomes...

460
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:02,453
More about the result, death.

461
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:04,455
If the victims are being judged,
you have to ask yourself,

462
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,257
why does the killer pick these victims?

463
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,593
What flips the switch from
having feelings about people

464
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,361
to murdering them?

465
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,632
I read Freaks three times.

466
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:18,305
My boss didn't make me reach out to you.
It was my idea.

467
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:20,538
I just didn't want
to inflate your ego any more,

468
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,807
but now I see that's not possible, so...

469
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,810
Go on, say something snarky.

470
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:28,212
No snark.

471
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:30,748
Glad you liked it.

472
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,487
I'm so late. There's Andy.

473
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,456
- Which one is she?
- The one

474
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,558
who's six foot, with stubble, and a man.

475
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,327
Come and meet him.

476
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,796
Is it okay
if I introduce you as Lizzie?

477
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:47,632
He doesn't know you're working with me.

478
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:50,893
How is it you can deduce
that, but not that I'm gay?

479
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,437
You should tell him.

480
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:57,642
I am so sorry I'm late.

481
00:21:57,644 --> 00:21:58,976
I'll explain later.

482
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:00,945
This is my friend Lizzie. This is Andy.

483
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:02,914
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

484
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,483
You want to grab a bite with us?

485
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:08,686
I'd love to, but II
promised Gary I'd be home early.

486
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:10,655
And I'm not.

487
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,757
- Hope I see you again. See you.
- All right.

488
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,361
Gary?

489
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:21,499
Gary?

490
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:23,735
Hey.

491
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:26,137
Hey.

492
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:59,212
As the prosecutor, do you know
if anyone Condon scammed

493
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:00,959
ever threatened his life?

494
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:02,807
Anyone who might seek revenge?

495
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:05,610
Some generic hate mail
but nothing specific

496
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:07,823
and nothing we felt needed
further investigation.

497
00:23:07,824 --> 00:23:10,758
If it was pretty clear Condon was
guilty of fraud, why was he let off?

498
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,861
We got the wrong judge.

499
00:23:13,863 --> 00:23:17,565
Judge Brooks is... is one
of those bythebook guys.

500
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:22,270
He used some arcane interpretation
of the law to clear Condon.

501
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:24,505
You should speak with him.

502
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:28,442
I didn't like Condon for what he did.

503
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:30,684
The guy was an upperechelon crook.

504
00:23:31,314 --> 00:23:32,914
But the law is the law.

505
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,916
So you think he was guilty?

506
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:37,985
My personal opinion doesn't
matter. That's not why I'm here.

507
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,821
You read my book?

508
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:43,357
Didn't even know it was there.

509
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,459
I thought you'd enjoy it, sir.

510
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:48,262
Thank you, Elliot. What's it about?

511
00:23:48,264 --> 00:23:49,597
Abnormal behavior.

512
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,966
I've always found that term
a bit redundant.

513
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:53,200
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

514
00:23:53,202 --> 00:23:54,936
Judge Brooks,

515
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,370
you've got Millard in five minutes

516
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,306
and then the hearing
for People v. Barbaro.

517
00:23:58,308 --> 00:23:59,547
Yeah.

518
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:02,577
This is my way of saying
it's time for you both to go.

519
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:03,575
Of course.

520
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:06,047
Yeah, don't worry.
He does the same thing to me.

521
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:09,584
I'd forget to eat lunch without Dan.

522
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:11,452
Thank you for your time.

523
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:12,954
Thank you.

524
00:24:12,956 --> 00:24:14,722
So Condon's guilty but gets off.

525
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:17,325
No known people who'd want
to hurt him, a grieving wife.

526
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:18,926
It may not be revenge, which means

527
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:20,761
we may not have our connection with Dino

528
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:23,531
and even less of an idea of how
to pinpoint the two of hearts.

529
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:26,033
I want to go see a friend
who may be able to help.

530
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:27,969
- Great. I'll drive.
- Alone.

531
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:30,171
He works undercover.

532
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:31,639
Um, I'm a cop.

533
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:33,240
Um, he isn't.

534
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:35,443
Soso you get to come everywhere with me,

535
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:37,078
but I can't go with you?

536
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,982
You just go do what you do.

537
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:07,441
And I thought you retired.

538
00:25:15,456 --> 00:25:16,917
Look at you.

539
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:19,186
So academicy.

540
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:20,921
Why does that sound like an insult?

541
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:22,713
'Cause it is.

542
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,994
You think it's someone
who found out you're CIA?

543
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:28,462
Was CIA.

544
00:25:28,464 --> 00:25:31,032
Potato, potahto. Don't make it personal.

545
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,212
I'm just saying it's possible.

546
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:33,834
Because he used a theme from your book?

547
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,269
Motif.

548
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:38,472
- Maybe he's a fan of your writing.
- Whatever.

549
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:42,643
Maybe when your case is over,
you'll return to your calling.

550
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:47,048
World's gotten scarier since you left.

551
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,252
I'll take whatever
you can get on the victims.

552
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:53,035
It's a shame.

553
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,557
You were the best operative
I ever worked with.

554
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,060
I bet you say that
to all your old colleagues.

555
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:01,362
Integrity, loyalty,

556
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:04,832
and balls... you had it all.

557
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:06,567
Until I realized I didn't.

558
00:26:07,703 --> 00:26:09,970
No room for relationships
in our business.

559
00:26:09,972 --> 00:26:11,505
That's why I'm single.

560
00:26:11,507 --> 00:26:13,007
You're single because no woman

561
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,809
in her right mind would marry you.

562
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:16,143
That, too.

563
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,594
Nobody comes or goes.
Canvass the building.

564
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,896
- Okay, Lizzie.
- Couple came in under the name Smith.

565
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:38,299
Not their first time, always Thursdays.

566
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:39,967
Room service waiter discovered them.

567
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:41,535
Door was open, and they were
shot at pointblank range.

568
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:42,737
Got to be an affair.

569
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:44,538
No married couple'd
have sex in a hotel room

570
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,088
in the middle of the afternoon.

571
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:50,077
Do you really think

572
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,413
the Dealer killed them
while they were having sex?

573
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:54,148
Or did he force them into this position?

574
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,150
- Power and control?
- The blood spatter

575
00:26:56,152 --> 00:26:57,530
suggests they were in bed.

576
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,360
Aha. Well, he's enjoying
himself, as demonstrated

577
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:04,058
by the playing card lodged...
of all places...

578
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,961
between Mrs. Smith's, cheeks.

579
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,430
Glad I'm not bagging it.

580
00:27:09,432 --> 00:27:12,500
Queen of hearts.

581
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:15,336
Mother of higher love,
powerful, successful.

582
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:18,739
Detective Needham, can we...?

583
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:25,379
Excuse me.

584
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:28,082
Wasn't the queen of hearts in.

585
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:30,751
- Alice in Wonderland?
- Yeah, yeah. The antagonist.

586
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:34,822
Foultempered, quick
to hand out death sentences.

587
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:36,824
Her famous line...
"Off with their heads!"

588
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:41,328
Excuse me.

589
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:47,868
What was that?

590
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,070
That was Harris, my last partner,

591
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:51,839
aka the Wandering Tongue.

592
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:54,208
Apparently he's got deep feelings for me.

593
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,044
I'd love to see how you treat
someone who can't stand you.

594
00:27:57,046 --> 00:27:59,246
Well, it appears our innocent young Dino

595
00:27:59,248 --> 00:28:01,182
got himself pulled in for dealing drugs.

596
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:03,651
Your friend works fast. Who is he?

597
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:06,787
Then his mom made a call,
and Dino got let off.

598
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:08,756
Okay. I'll follow up
with the mom, and don't think

599
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:10,858
I didn't notice you evading
my question about your friend.

600
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,459
- That's all you got?
- He's working on more.

601
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:13,584
Just give him a little more time.

602
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:15,930
Explains why Dino was the king of clubs,

603
00:28:15,932 --> 00:28:19,233
but not how he's connected
to the Smiths or Condon.

604
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,837
Watch out!

605
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:30,110
Nobody move! Shooter's on the mezzanine.

606
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,715
- Stay here.
- No problem.

607
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:05,012
Son of a bitch got away.

608
00:29:05,014 --> 00:29:06,847
- Yeah.
- Aah!

609
00:29:13,557 --> 00:29:15,863
Why would the Dealer stay at the scene?

610
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,129
Was he trapped?

611
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:20,297
- Targeting us?
- Maybe he just wants us to stay away.

612
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,767
- Here are the credit card receipts.
- Thanks.

613
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,635
32 of our guests paid with cash.

614
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,203
That's a lot, no?

615
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:27,238
But not for us.

616
00:29:27,954 --> 00:29:29,607
Where's your surveillance footage?

617
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:31,175
Sorry. We removed our cameras.

618
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:34,245
Our hotel is a luxury, rendezvous spot.

619
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:36,637
We protect the privacy of our clients.

620
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:38,610
How's that working out for your clients?

621
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,886
So the Dealer knew
the Smiths were cheating.

622
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:44,321
So we're really sticking with the Dealer?

623
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:45,956
It's descriptive and short.

624
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,728
So is the perp, writer.

625
00:29:48,361 --> 00:29:50,461
So the Dealer knew
the Smiths were cheating,

626
00:29:50,463 --> 00:29:52,430
and in a place you couldn't be filmed,

627
00:29:52,432 --> 00:29:54,398
so I'd say a jealous spouse?

628
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,033
Who also knew Dino and Condon?

629
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:57,701
Which is why I didn't say it.

630
00:29:57,703 --> 00:29:59,904
So Dino dealt, Condon stole,
the Smiths cheated.

631
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:02,473
There's one thing that jumps out
they all have in common.

632
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:04,809
They're all lawbreakers,
criminals, douches.

633
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:07,912
If that's his beef, he'll
have to kill half of New York.

634
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,049
There's something else they
may all have in common.

635
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:14,084
- Here you go, Lizzie.
- Thank you, Jim.

636
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:18,022
Keith Millard, aka Mr. Smith.

637
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,992
Arrested seven years ago for
driving while intoxicated.

638
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:24,094
Jennifer Scott, aka Mrs. Smith,

639
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:26,119
arrested for child endangerment.

640
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:29,867
So, they all committed crimes,
but Condon wasn't found guilty.

641
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:33,370
Neither was Mr. or Mrs. Smith.

642
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:35,773
Let me try Dino.

643
00:30:40,445 --> 00:30:42,513
Nothing. Sealed.

644
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:44,782
What? You can't access sealed documents?

645
00:30:44,784 --> 00:30:46,383
That's why they're sealed.

646
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:47,618
That's why I have friends.

647
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:56,293
How did you get these?

648
00:30:56,295 --> 00:30:58,487
These court documents are privileged.

649
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,532
Yeah, so is my friend,
who just sent over these.

650
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:04,631
I'm finally starting to realize
why you're so intriguing.

651
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:06,904
You're not just
some boring old professor.

652
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,873
You're... FBI?

653
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,378
Door number two.

654
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:16,146
Case officer?

655
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:17,147
And paramilitary.

656
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:18,883
Whoa! You're a tough guy.

657
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:20,384
Was a tough guy.

658
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:21,819
- Retired?
- In '14.

659
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:22,853
Why?

660
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:26,524
I had other responsibilities.

661
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:33,163
Dino Moretti, arrested age 16
for selling dope.

662
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,134
The day before his trial,
the charges were expunged

663
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:39,003
and the record sealed.

664
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:40,638
All arrested, none convicted.

665
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,940
And not because
they were necessarily innocent.

666
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,875
Condon and the Smiths' cases
involved technicalities

667
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:46,443
or loopholes their lawyers exploited.

668
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:48,812
So, the law said the victims
were not guilty,

669
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:50,748
but the Dealer thinks differently.

670
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,550
Or he knows differently.

671
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:55,085
- Judge Brooks.
- Yeah.

672
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,054
Check and see if Brooks presided
over those other cases.

673
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:59,256
Mr. Smith, Brooks.

674
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:02,126
Mrs. Smith...

675
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,103
Brooks.

676
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,696
Dino Moretti.

677
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,098
Judge Gerald Brooks.

678
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,606
Maybe the judge knows
more than he's telling us.

679
00:32:10,608 --> 00:32:14,371
Needless to say, I'm distressed
to learn that I'm the link.

680
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:17,575
But I would not change
even one of my rulings.

681
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:19,677
The law can't protect the innocent

682
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,345
without sometimes helping the guilty.

683
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:23,881
So you believe
all the victims were guilty

684
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:25,215
even though you made trial decisions

685
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:26,550
that helped them go free.

686
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:28,886
I make trial decisions based on the law,

687
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:30,454
not what my gut tells me.

688
00:32:30,456 --> 00:32:32,323
Nothing I do on the bench is personal.

689
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,201
Someone out there disagrees with you.

690
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:37,328
And he or she is taking it personally.

691
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,464
Then I hope for all our sakes
that you catch him...

692
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:42,232
expeditiously.

693
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:45,636
Does the queen of hearts ring any
bells regarding a past case?

694
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:48,405
I once had a man who thought
he was the prince of Wales.

695
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:51,575
Otherwise I have not
had any royalty before me.

696
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:53,777
I will give it thought.

697
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,580
Elliot? Queen of hearts.

698
00:32:56,582 --> 00:32:59,383
- Anyone come to mind?
- No, sir.

699
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:02,086
But I can ask Dan to print up
summaries of all your cases.

700
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,799
Much appreciated.

701
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,173
Be prepared. This might take a while.

702
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:08,833
So, who's the queen of hearts?

703
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:10,394
The writer of a romance novel?

704
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:12,162
- Prostitute?
- Drag queen?

705
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:13,782
Any chance it's you?

706
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,599
First of all, why would
my saying "drag queen"

707
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:16,734
lead you to me?

708
00:33:16,736 --> 00:33:18,702
And second, I don't get treated
like a queen,

709
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:21,805
and my colleagues don't think
I have a heart, so no.

710
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:23,674
If you don't get treated like a queen,

711
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:25,376
then why are you with Gary?

712
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,315
Yeah, you're right. None of my business.

713
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:32,750
I'm sure he's a wonderful guy.

714
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:34,807
One question, though.

715
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:37,287
Will Gary mind that you're
out to such a fancy meal

716
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:38,789
with another man?

717
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:41,158
Is Gary bigger than me?

718
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,327
That's two questions.

719
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:46,997
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to upset you.

720
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,011
Did you guys have a fight or something?

721
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:53,103
Gary's not my boyfriend.

722
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:55,339
He's my dog, and I have to put him down.

723
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,875
I know it's stupid and crazy

724
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:00,611
for me to be sitting here,
crying about this

725
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:02,579
given what we're dealing with at work.

726
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:04,448
No, no, no, no. I've had dogs.

727
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,117
When they die, it's heartbreaking.

728
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,019
Charlie and I rescued him.

729
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:14,786
My old partner and my fiancé.

730
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:19,124
He was shot and killed
in the line of duty a year ago.

731
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,399
I'm sorry.

732
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,255
Gary's all I have left of him, and...

733
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:28,175
I don't want him to disappear.

734
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,775
It's not fair.

735
00:34:32,977 --> 00:34:34,598
It's...

736
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:38,560
it's like every day
my heart is growing colder.

737
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,918
I don't mean to unload on you.

738
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,986
No, no. It'sit's okay.

739
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:44,822
- Heart.
- You're mourning.

740
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:46,526
- Just give it time.
- No.

741
00:34:46,528 --> 00:34:49,760
There's a doctor Brooks had in his court,

742
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:51,615
a famous cardiologist.

743
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,299
Charged with vehicular manslaughter

744
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,201
and found not guilty.

745
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:58,084
Brooks disallowed the testimony

746
00:34:58,086 --> 00:34:59,903
of the key witness for the prosecution

747
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:01,271
due to some absurd precedent

748
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,877
- brought by the defense.
- She's got to be our queen of hearts.

749
00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:08,278
Get someone over to the home
of Dr. Caitlyn Glenroy.

750
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,468
8 East 72nd Street. Now.

751
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,753
- Hey.
- Victim's deceased.

752
00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:18,021
He must have shocked her with
the paddles. It's pretty bad.

753
00:35:18,023 --> 00:35:19,289
We must have just missed him.

754
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,485
Which playing card did he leave?

755
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:22,938
There isn't one.

756
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:28,065
I thought you said she was dead.

757
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,767
She looked dead.
II didn't want to touch her.

758
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:31,535
No, she's still warm. No pulse.

759
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:33,232
The shock from the defib
must have knocked her out,

760
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,471
but it didn't kill her.

761
00:35:34,473 --> 00:35:36,673
- Not yet.
- Tom, the paramedics. Now.

762
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,477
You think the Dealer screwed up?

763
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:42,412
No, he thought she was dead.

764
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:45,252
He had no idea we'd get here this fast.

765
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:47,918
But why no card?

766
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,586
Is he done?

767
00:35:49,588 --> 00:35:51,321
Has his plan changed?

768
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,295
Brooks' clerks check out. No priors.

769
00:35:58,297 --> 00:35:59,963
One, two, three.

770
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:04,134
- Joker.
- The court jester.

771
00:36:04,136 --> 00:36:06,790
- He's after Judge Brooks.
- Come on.

772
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:19,280
- Everything all right?
- Judge hasn't left the premises.

773
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:20,740
Is anyone in there?

774
00:36:20,742 --> 00:36:22,330
Just the judge and his wife.

775
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,432
What are you doing?

776
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:34,687
You wanted a gun?

777
00:36:34,689 --> 00:36:36,136
It's okay. I got one.

778
00:36:44,231 --> 00:36:45,698
Do you plan on just watching?

779
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,312
I was afraid kicking
down the door for you

780
00:36:47,314 --> 00:36:49,169
would be disempowering.

781
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,537
Look, we can do it together, okay?

782
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:54,107
Ready, on three? One, two, three.

783
00:36:58,405 --> 00:36:59,784
Are you okay?

784
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:01,744
I should be asking you that.

785
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:03,576
- Are your clerks here?
- Why would they be here?

786
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,395
They're usually still at the office.

787
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,421
- Hardest working clerks I've ever had.
- Court clerks.

788
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:10,123
The court jester.

789
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,258
- Apologies, Your Honor.
- Yeah.

790
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:30,459
Elliot, are you okay?

791
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:34,415
You're right on time.

792
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,566
Dr. Reinhart,
I thought it would be fitting

793
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:39,602
for you to witness the final part

794
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:41,337
of the idea you helped inspire.

795
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:43,439
But first...

796
00:37:43,953 --> 00:37:45,675
please put the guns down.

797
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:49,211
Guns down!

798
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:50,746
Or I swear I'll kill him.

799
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:52,128
Okay, Dan.

800
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:55,818
From one freak to another, I get it.

801
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,486
If I were you,

802
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:59,688
I probably would have shot him
through the heart by now.

803
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:03,492
All those years. Endless hours.

804
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:05,861
All the hard work you put in
to help bring justice,

805
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:08,964
and now you think
this guy just undid it all.

806
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:11,534
Maybe he doesn't deserve to live.

807
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:13,936
I know what you're feeling.

808
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,705
Gratitude.

809
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,708
Yes, I was outraged

810
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,282
by the victims' verdicts, but...

811
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,179
reading your book

812
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,214
made me realize

813
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:27,381
- I could do something about it.
- And you have.

814
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:30,486
And now it can end.

815
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:32,530
Elliot didn't do anything.

816
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:35,324
Elliot did the legwork for Judge Brooks

817
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,026
to find those obscure cases.

818
00:38:38,064 --> 00:38:39,634
The shady loopholes

819
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:41,897
and precedents to get the criminals off.

820
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:43,365
Dan, I was just - Hey.

821
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:44,500
Doing my job.

822
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:45,868
Please.

823
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,770
A collaborator's favorite excuse.

824
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:50,372
Doesn't make you any less guilty

825
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:53,909
than Dino, Condon, any of them.

826
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:57,413
But he wasn't in control of it,
unlike the criminals...

827
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,548
and you.

828
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,521
We're all capable of behaving abnormally.

829
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,701
You've restored what is right.

830
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,491
Those who deserve
to be punished have been,

831
00:39:08,493 --> 00:39:10,826
and justice has been done.

832
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,562
But if you kill Elliot right now,

833
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:16,296
you are as guilty as they are.

834
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,169
You're better than them.

835
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:24,740
Give me the gun.

836
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:26,675
No!

837
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:36,752
Hold on, Lizzie.

838
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:44,794
You okay? Dial 911.

839
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:46,061
Tell them 1013.

840
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:47,429
Do it now.

841
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,398
Cuff that guy.

842
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,833
Hang in there, Lizzie.

843
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,668
Come on, come on.

844
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,069
Come on.

845
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:55,671
Okay, come on.

846
00:39:57,874 --> 00:40:00,843
Okay, when you lay there,
just stay with me, Lizzie.

847
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:02,342
Stay with me.

848
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,747
She took a bullet to the chest.

849
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:06,515
She's having trouble breathing.

850
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:08,017
It could be a tension pneumothorax.

851
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,318
You got it.

852
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:00,733
Hey.

853
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:05,608
Well, you look terrible.

854
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,310
Expecting "I don't care
how I look" pantsuit

855
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:09,612
and humdrum flats?

856
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:11,480
Come in.

857
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:13,121
Thanks.

858
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:16,719
So, how are you holding up?

859
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:18,587
It was a through and through. I'm fine.

860
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:19,922
Just a little sore.

861
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,590
Well, a lot sore.

862
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:24,212
But I wasn't gonna leave
Gary alone any longer.

863
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:26,629
Hey, Gary.

864
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:30,566
Thank you. You saved my life.

865
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:31,834
You were brave.

866
00:41:31,836 --> 00:41:34,136
Stupid but brave.

867
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:35,838
That's what I want on my tombstone.

868
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,307
You nearly got it.
No, those are for you.

869
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:42,611
It's like you didn't mind getting killed,

870
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:44,480
like youyou didn't care.

871
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:45,981
Spare me the psychobabble.

872
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,416
How's Dan the Dealer?

873
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:50,419
He asked for an autograph.

874
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,553
My God. I know,

875
00:41:51,555 --> 00:41:53,088
it's not... I'm sorry.

876
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,291
At least you're having an impact
on your readers.

877
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:56,792
Isn't that what every writer wants?

878
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:58,297
Stop it. Now.

879
00:41:58,299 --> 00:41:59,508
Do you want some?

880
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,255
I'ml'm trying to lay off the carbs.

881
00:42:07,546 --> 00:42:08,971
You know,

882
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,140
I haven't trusted anyone since Charlie.

883
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:14,410
So... if the teaching thing gets boring,

884
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:16,111
maybe you want to, you know...

885
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:18,498
I could use a partner
in any form I can get.

886
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,049
Maybe you should have been a cop.

887
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:23,919
I should have been a lot of things.

888
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:25,902
There's still time.

889
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:30,459
This might be the perfect opportunity.

890
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:32,895
Those that can't do and all.

891
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:35,531
I have a deadline for my next book,

892
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:36,765
and I need some new ideas

893
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,434
because apparently my old ones

894
00:42:38,436 --> 00:42:40,502
lack pizzazz and heart.

895
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,706
You're not gonna believe this.

896
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,774
They fished a body
out of the Hudson last night,

897
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:47,943
and its heart was missing.

898
00:42:55,965 --> 00:43:03,965

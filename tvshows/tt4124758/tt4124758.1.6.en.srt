1
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:03,582
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:06,468
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

3
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:08,730
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

4
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:10,511
I became Professor Reinhart.

5
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:12,263
I wrote a book about abnormal behavior

6
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:14,269
and criminals, which was so successful

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,271
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

8
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:18,739
That's when the
New York Police Department

9
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:20,774
reached out to me to help catch him.

10
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,442
Which I did, so they hired me,

11
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:24,111
and I became Consultant Reinhart.

12
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:26,163
So now I'm working with this woman,

13
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:27,614
Detective Lizzie Needham

14
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:30,167
of the homicide division,
catching killers.

15
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:31,785
Looks like I need a new name.

16
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:33,787
Don't they call you Professor Psychopath?

17
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:48,588
Officer, our murder suspect
is Theodore Burton.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,057
Last seen leaving the residence
of his mortgage broker,

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,760
who he stabbed and killed.
He's armed and dangerous.

20
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,738
Let's get this out to

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,646
all units working.

22
00:00:56,648 --> 00:00:58,931
Hey, go to 47 Wall Street...
Potter & Marley.

23
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,650
Theo has an appointment there
in 15 minutes.

24
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:03,903
85 me two units
to Potter & Marley Investments

25
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:05,405
for arrest assistance.

26
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:06,773
The suspect has one victim

27
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,941
and may be on his way to kill again.

28
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,274
Here. My dupe shield.

29
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,040
- Dupe shield?
- Duplicate.

30
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,002
A place like this won't let
you in without a badge,

31
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:20,670
and we don't have time to explain.

32
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,291
Theo?

33
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,960
- Theo?
- No. No!

34
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,800
Wait. Hey, hey. Okay,
everybody, please stay calm.

35
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,134
Stay seated. Let us handle this.

36
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:40,473
I'll go talk to him.

37
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,025
No, you won't. You're gonna wait

38
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:44,143
for the hostage negotiators to get here.

39
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:47,146
Okay. Dylan.

40
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,314
- Wait.
- Theo.

41
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,137
- Dylan.
- My name is Dylan. I'm not a cop.

42
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,818
I-I just want to talk to you.

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,619
I want to hear your side of the story.

44
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,955
You want to talk?

45
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:57,156
Yeah.

46
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,491
Talk to these con men.

47
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,659
They're your best buddy

48
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,077
when you're writing a check.

49
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,663
Yeah, all these great stocks they got.

50
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,935
And then they rob you blind!

51
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,552
You trusted them?

52
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,722
But it's their system.

53
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,390
They control it.

54
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,677
I manage a grocery store.

55
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,645
Well, you gotta be smart with your money.

56
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:21,064
Yeah.

57
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:25,334
I invested 12% a month
every month for 15 years.

58
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,187
It's gone.

59
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,522
All of it.

60
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,325
This company stole my nest egg.

61
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:34,193
They took everything.

62
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,528
Just isn't fair.

63
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,996
I get it.

64
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,116
There's nothing I can do about it.

65
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,952
They make their money off your hard work.

66
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,288
The world just isn't set up
to protect the little guy.

67
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,289
No,

68
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,007
tell those cops not to arrest me.

69
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,009
No, no. They should arrest these thieves.

70
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,377
They-they should arrest
the whole entire company!

71
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,212
Theo, look at me.
Keep your eyes on me. Theo!

72
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,714
I have a family.

73
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,516
I-I can't go to jail.

74
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,851
I won't!

75
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:00,436
I-I won't, I won't!

76
00:03:03,274 --> 00:03:05,108
My leg! Aah! My leg!

77
00:03:08,696 --> 00:03:10,780
My leg..

78
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:18,002
I can practically see
the germs floating around us.

79
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:19,364
If you're not sick when you get here,

80
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,406
you will be when you leave.

81
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,741
Hospitals are the worst.

82
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,682
Except for the whole
"healing people" thing.

83
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:25,378
There is that. When I get home,
I'm going to bathe

84
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,712
- in hand sanitizer.
- Excuse me, sir.

85
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:27,747
Police. She's with me.

86
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,465
I'm the police. I just said that.

87
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,084
- Don't ever do that again.
- Or what... you'll arrest me?

88
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:36,088
When I ask you to wait for the
hostage negotiators, you wait.

89
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,257
Theo was there because he felt
he had no control.

90
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,593
The banks had lost his money,
and he had no recourse.

91
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,178
He was pushed into crisis.

92
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,063
The-the tension in his voice, the...

93
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:45,765
the impulsive twitching of his body.

94
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,433
We couldn't wait for the negotiators.

95
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,684
He needed to feel listened to.

96
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,269
- Hey.
- Hey.

97
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,521
He's on a morphine drip for pain,

98
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,439
and we just hung antibiotics.

99
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,649
How soon will I get out of here?

100
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:55,932
Not up to me.

101
00:03:58,223 --> 00:03:59,639
Don't let them anywhere near me.

102
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:02,415
- Calm down.
- You try and clock me one more time,

103
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,033
I will give you something to cry about.

104
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,501
Don't make me talk to the police!

105
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:07,003
You didn't want to talk to the cops,

106
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:08,788
shouldn't have been playing with knives.

107
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,548
The miracle of modern medicine.

108
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,299
The miracle of lorazepam, you mean.

109
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,718
Two milligrams is like
a wrench to the head.

110
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,771
I feel bad for that guy.

111
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:28,306
He was taken advantage of.

112
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,642
Doesn't give him the right to kill.

113
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:32,811
Are you okay? You look off.

114
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:35,280
Well, I just...
I'm not good with hospitals.

115
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:37,732
Nurse Albany? Hi.

116
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,034
I'm... Give me a sec.

117
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:40,402
We're police. We need an update

118
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:41,953
on Theo Burton's condition, please.

119
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,455
Knife wound to the leg.

120
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:44,489
Hemodynamically stable.

121
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,657
He'll be fine.

122
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,042
You have a lovely bedside manner.

123
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:48,088
When can we talk to him?

124
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,911
After his CT angio.

125
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,580
I told you, your wife
has been discharged.

126
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,862
You can't send her
to the nursing home like this.

127
00:04:53,864 --> 00:04:55,500
- Get her shoes on.
- She could get septic again,

128
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:57,002
and we'll be back here tomorrow.

129
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:58,470
She got her antibiotics. She'll be fine.

130
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,838
Move the meat, right?

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,140
Because that's all
sick people are to you?

132
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:03,592
You keep discharging her too early.

133
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,260
How about a little compassion?

134
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:06,561
Here's your compassion.

135
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:09,322
Leave on your own, or I call security.

136
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:11,349
Nurses on TV are so much nicer.

137
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,652
Nurses on TV aren't real.

138
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:15,904
I didn't know dogs
were allowed in the E.R.

139
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:17,572
No dogs!

140
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:19,324
I need this E.R. to remain sanitary.

141
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:21,359
I need Conan for my anxiety.

142
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,662
See a shrink, and get the dog out!

143
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,114
Blue team to E.R.

144
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:28,013
Blue team to E.R.

145
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:30,368
This patient's gonna arrest!

146
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,536
Bring a crash cart!

147
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:33,171
Get a doctor in here!

148
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:35,957
- Respiration's shallow.
- That's Theo.

149
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,959
He's bradying down. BP's dropping.

150
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:39,461
Someone get me an amp of atropine now.

151
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,713
- Doctor, he's in v-fib.
- Call a code!

152
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:45,050
Code blue in the E.R.

153
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:46,801
Code Blue in Emergency.

154
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,303
The nurse said he was fine.

155
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:49,938
Then why does it look
like they're losing him?

156
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,998
I thought this patient was stable.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,724
- He was.
- Charging. Clear!

158
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:58,530
- This makes no sense.
- Shock again.

159
00:05:58,532 --> 00:05:59,614
Charging.

160
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:00,732
Clear.

161
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,237
So, let me get this straight:
Your perp was

162
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,406
stable one minute, then dead
the next... just like that?

163
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:35,510
- Yeah. The doctor was flummoxed.
- Flummoxed?

164
00:06:35,535 --> 00:06:36,791
Poleaxed.

165
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:37,985
He thinks it might have been

166
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,703
an undetected vascular compromise, but...

167
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,455
He was fishing for answers.

168
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:43,741
The hospital is scheduling a
quality review of the case.

169
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:45,126
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

170
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:46,827
They've got more red tape than we do.

171
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:48,746
Needham, Doc, don't shoot the messenger,

172
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:50,164
but you got a CUPI.

173
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,249
That's not contagious, is it?

174
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,453
Circumstances undetermined
pending investigation.

175
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:57,068
A CUPI's a case that keeps on kicking

176
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,088
even after death.

177
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,807
It is worse than contagious.

178
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:03,227
Someone called the tip line
about your man Theo Burton.

179
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:04,595
"Your suspect is not the first person

180
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:07,815
that Crosstown Hospital m... murdered "".

181
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:15,105
Murdering patients? Really?

182
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:17,274
That's quite an accusation.

183
00:07:17,276 --> 00:07:20,444
Theodore Burton was stable when
he died in your E.R. yesterday.

184
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:21,912
Detectives, it's a hospital.

185
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:23,280
Sometimes people die.

186
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:25,429
Sometimes people live. Look, I get it.

187
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:27,034
We just have to follow
up on these things.

188
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:29,119
- It's procedure.
- Well, an unexpected death

189
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:31,088
hardly indicates criminality.

190
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,979
The majority of
the patient deaths that occur

191
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,926
in Crosstown General's E.R. are among

192
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:37,865
the critically injured, ill, or DOA.

193
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,964
We are not talking about
the majority of deaths.

194
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,244
We're talking about people who die

195
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:43,332
in unexpected or unusual circumstances.

196
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,908
As a hospital administrator,
maybe you can help us out

197
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,840
with a list of patients
who have recently died.

198
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,932
Patient privacy laws won't allow that.

199
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,030
So I'll get a subpoena, come back,

200
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:53,832
and then you'll give me a list?

201
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:56,115
Can we streamline that process?

202
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:57,750
Not without a warrant, we can't.

203
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,287
Sorry. I just heard about this meeting.

204
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:03,205
These folks are from the precinct.

205
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,091
This is Dr. James Walters,

206
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,676
a very busy E.R. physician.

207
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:08,427
I'm also the chief quality officer

208
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:10,379
for the Emergency Department,
so if you have any concerns

209
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,431
about irregularities, I'm never too busy

210
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:13,883
to answer questions.

211
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,018
So, there have been irregularities?

212
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,720
Not at all.

213
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:18,888
There is one E.R. nurse

214
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,473
currently under administrative review.

215
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,358
Not for any malfeasance, of course.

216
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,026
Nurse Albany has our full support.

217
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:25,645
She's a top-notch caregiver...

218
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:27,229
I'm sorry, Detectives.

219
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,564
My legal department won't allow

220
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,232
such disclosures.

221
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:32,068
Please...

222
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,403
strike that nurse's name
from your record.

223
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:38,874
Gentlemen, I trust that
you will send our perp

224
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:41,911
Theo Burton's body to
the M.E. for an autopsy.

225
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:45,331
That was her name... Nurse Albany.

226
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,717
The same nurse who was looking
after Theo before he died.

227
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,085
So Reilly's suspicious of her,

228
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:50,753
and that's why he's put her on review,

229
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:51,971
or he's covering something up.

230
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:54,526
The man is clearly a snake in a suit.

231
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,226
Okay, so even if he is a reptile,

232
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:58,311
he still can't give us
names without a subpoena.

233
00:08:58,313 --> 00:08:59,845
But while we wait for that subpoena,

234
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,097
more patients could die.

235
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,264
We've gotta keep digging.

236
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,599
I know that following the rules

237
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,101
is a tough concept for you,

238
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:06,652
but we have certain
protocols and procedures,

239
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:08,404
and they're there for a reason.

240
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:10,072
Rules can influence behavior,

241
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:12,575
but behavior can also influence rules.

242
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,610
I'm not talking about behavior and rules.

243
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,529
I'm talking about the law.

244
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,364
I'm gonna call in for a subpoena.

245
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:21,083
And your digging... keep it legal.

246
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,785
Don't tell me.

247
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:25,287
You need intel, and the
NYPD's slowing you down.

248
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,956
This is why I left the CIA.

249
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,958
Because your mind works
a million miles a minute

250
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
and everyone else's moves
like they're running underwater?

251
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:32,853
No, I left because I couldn't stand

252
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:34,263
working in an institution.

253
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:37,433
You do realize the NYPD
is an institution, don't you?

254
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:39,211
Thank you for enlightening me.

255
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:41,103
And I'm a consultant, so...

256
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:42,772
You've never liked authority.

257
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:44,640
While you've been a big fan?

258
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:47,276
We're not with the Company anymore.

259
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:49,979
We're free to work how we want.

260
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:51,897
Think of the fun we could have.

261
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,855
There have been some unusual deaths

262
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:56,235
in the E.R.
at Crosstown General Hospital.

263
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:58,988
I have been digging around
but found next to nothing.

264
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,740
I need to know
what they're not telling us.

265
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:02,458
Maybe they're telling the truth.

266
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,893
Yeah, because big corporations

267
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,162
just love to share the truth.

268
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,584
The hospital has an impressive firewall.

269
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:15,004
I'm going to need some time.

270
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,738
Try the New York Ledger.

271
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,208
I read a tiny article
about irregularities

272
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,810
at Crosstown General, but the article

273
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:24,612
didn't have a byline.

274
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:32,086
The Ledger's mainframe has
a private file with all kinds

275
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:35,806
of info on the poor care
at Crosstown's E.R.

276
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,427
But none of the articles
have been published.

277
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:43,097
The info is in the file of one reporter.

278
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,955
Rebecca Dunmar.

279
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,354
I mostly cover new tech releases.

280
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,655
My editor says, before he can put me

281
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:53,691
on any investigative work,
he needs a slam dunk.

282
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:56,410
There's been a 20% uptick in E.R. deaths

283
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:58,419
over the last year, and yet he'll say,

284
00:10:58,421 --> 00:11:00,281
"No, Becca, that
still isn't a story."

285
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,333
The hospital's a major advertiser,

286
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:03,617
so my editor is probably afraid

287
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:05,119
to give Crosstown any bad publicity.

288
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:07,088
But let me tell you,

289
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,168
Crosstown General's staff
is careless and incompetent.

290
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,594
Till the story gets out there,
the killing's not going to stop.

291
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:16,530
You weren't the caller who left
the anonymous tip, were you?

292
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,549
No. My job is to report the news,

293
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:19,934
not to make it happen.

294
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:22,687
If you want to talk to any of my sources,

295
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:23,938
I'd be happy to give you a few names.

296
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,773
- That would be helpful.
- Yeah, um...

297
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:28,109
try the Taylors... Derek and Vanessa.

298
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:30,027
Their story will break your heart.

299
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,697
They didn't just rob Vanessa of her life.

300
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:34,699
They destroyed Derek's, too.

301
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,702
Vanessa didn't actually die,

302
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:39,787
but Crosstown certainly
caused her suffering.

303
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:42,239
She went to the E.R.
with heart palpitations,

304
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,493
and the doctor sent her away
with anxiety medication.

305
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:48,546
She had hypothyroidism, not anxiety,

306
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:50,553
and now it's just tragic.

307
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,970
Hey, Needham, looks
like you have a visitor.

308
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:03,260
Pete the Stalker,
look at you all cleaned up.

309
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:04,428
You look nice.

310
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,646
Thank you.

311
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:06,764
Actually, turns out

312
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,311
I'm not a stalker.

313
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:09,618
Um...

314
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,739
I never intended to scare Maggie.

315
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:13,980
Okay.

316
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:15,705
So, what brings you in?

317
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,697
Well, my boss fired me after the,

318
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,026
incident.

319
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:21,362
But Linda, the police
psychologist you recommended,

320
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,446
thinks that I am rehabilitated.

321
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:24,031
In fact, she wrote
a letter of recommendation

322
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,249
to help me get a job.

323
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:27,168
Good for you, Pete.

324
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,619
She also thought it might be helpful

325
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:29,787
if you would sign it.

326
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,956
You want me to help you find a job?

327
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,208
Great. Thank you.

328
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,821
You sound beautiful.

329
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:08,242
Your wife had a left-brain stroke.

330
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,536
11 months ago.

331
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,713
How'd you know?

332
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:15,166
Music and memorized lyrics

333
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:17,924
live in a region of the brain
undamaged by aphasia.

334
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,390
That's why your wife

335
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:21,505
can't talk to you but can still sing.

336
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:25,439
I'm Dylan Reinhart from the NYPD.

337
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:26,680
I was hoping to ask you

338
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,305
a few questions about Crosstown General.

339
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:30,892
If you're here to talk
about that hospital,

340
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,044
ask as many questions as you want.

341
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,738
A year ago, me and Vanessa were training

342
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,492
to run the New York Marathon.

343
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:42,026
Now I'm pushing my wife in a wheelchair,

344
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,171
and she's living in a nursing home.

345
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:46,780
Dr. Walters misdiagnosed her.

346
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,833
The hospital has a team of
lawyers covering everything up.

347
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,701
Then why do you keep going back there?

348
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:53,336
I don't have a choice.

349
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,505
We don't have great health insurance.

350
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:57,707
Before Vanessa got sick,

351
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,959
the two of us were gonna launch
an online startup.

352
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:03,713
Now... I just make ends meet
as best I can.

353
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,635
Maybe I should be grateful.

354
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:11,971
At least Vanessa didn't die
like the others.

355
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,551
I think someone at Crosstown

356
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:18,076
is purposely killing patients.

357
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:36,629
I'm a little scared

358
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:37,830
for whoever's pissing you off.

359
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:39,299
He must be a jerk.

360
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:42,468
"He" is my job, and I like it.

361
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:45,338
But yeah, it's been rough.

362
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,056
I'm Jeff.

363
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,225
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hi.

364
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm working out.

365
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:53,730
Give me two minutes?

366
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:56,349
I'm on lunch, so you have
45 seconds before my next round.

367
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:58,735
Yeah, I was hoping to
talk you out of that.

368
00:14:58,737 --> 00:15:00,019
What?

369
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:01,821
Well, I'm a personal trainer.

370
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:03,022
Those burpees that you're doing

371
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:04,741
are killer on your knees and lower back.

372
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:07,911
Even if your form is perfect.

373
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:09,376
Here.

374
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,749
And what am I supposed
to do with these, Jeff?

375
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:15,335
We're gonna do an overhead
tricep extension.

376
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,178
All right? May I?

377
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:20,340
Okay, so you're gonna start
with your arms over your head.

378
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:23,042
You're gonna bend at the elbows,
keeping your shoulders still.

379
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:24,110
Like this?

380
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:25,628
My God.

381
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,931
My God. Are you okay?

382
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:28,932
I'm good, I'm good.

383
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,016
It's okay. I'm good.

384
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,267
Well, what can I do?

385
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,802
God. Well, I was gonna...

386
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:34,687
I was gonna ask you
for your phone number.

387
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,641
Kind of hard to say no to me now?

388
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:41,527
Yeah... yeah, it is.

389
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,698
No.

390
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,151
God, I'm sorry. It's okay.

391
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:49,986
Elizabeth Needham.

392
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:51,454
Detective.

393
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:54,207
Does the NYPD let you carry a gun?

394
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,209
You're practically a deadly
weapon all on your own.

395
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:01,914
You find anything?

396
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,333
I shouldn't work out during lunch.

397
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:04,684
What happened?

398
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:06,803
I met a guy and gave him a bloody nose.

399
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:08,504
- He asked me out.
- Of course he did.

400
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,089
He's a trainer.

401
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:11,891
I'll give you the story later.

402
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:13,343
I filed the subpoena.

403
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:14,677
Waiting to hear back.

404
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,678
You get anything?

405
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,263
As a matter of fact, I did.

406
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:20,807
I think Crosstown Hospital
has an angel of death.

407
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:21,895
An angel of death? Really?

408
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,519
Derek says he feels someone

409
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,488
in the E.R. is trying to kill patients.

410
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,939
And you think it's Nurse Albany?

411
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:28,608
Well, we saw the way she treated people.

412
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,827
And she transferred from Oregon
a year ago.

413
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:33,363
Right before the uptick
in patients dying.

414
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:34,365
Yes.

415
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:37,250
How'd you find that out so quickly?

416
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,453
Never mind. I don't want to know.

417
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:42,316
Oregon is a right-to-die state.

418
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:44,090
You do realize that Death with Dignity

419
00:16:44,092 --> 00:16:46,092
- is not the same as murder?
- I do.

420
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:48,511
But if our killer's M.O.
is poison by administering

421
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,296
either too much
or too little medication...

422
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,181
Don't get ahead of yourself
with the poison theory.

423
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:55,051
We're still waiting on the
tox results to confirm C.O.D.

424
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,352
Lizzie, remember, I need you

425
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:57,937
to get those after-action reports.

426
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,472
On it, on it.

427
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,692
Okay, tell me your theories...
the credible ones...

428
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,861
while I go through these reports.

429
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:07,780
Well, it may be
that our angel of death...

430
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,315
Possible angel of death.

431
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:10,950
Isn't motivated by a moral compass.

432
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,819
They don't have any mercy.

433
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:15,621
They want to kill rather than care for

434
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:17,237
annoying or demanding patients.

435
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,098
It's also may be
that these patients' deaths

436
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,077
were tragic medical misfortunes.

437
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,962
When someone dies unexpectedly
in a hospital,

438
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:24,497
people want someone to blame.

439
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:26,416
They can't blame God or fate, so...

440
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:28,668
they blame their nurse or doctor.

441
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,938
You're being very protective
of the hospital institution.

442
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,537
The hospital institution saves lives.

443
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:44,317
Okay, I'm not an expert
in human behavior, but...

444
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,651
something's eating at you.

445
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:46,853
I know that you hate hospitals,

446
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,457
but this seems personal.

447
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:52,977
Okay, we don't have to talk about it.

448
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:58,281
When I was in sixth grade,
my mom was in a cancer ward.

449
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,867
I'd go visit her after school.

450
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:03,753
Sixth grade? I'm so sorry.

451
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,454
I remember one of my mom's caregivers,

452
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,208
Janet...

453
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:11,294
she was giving Mom a bath

454
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:13,121
after one of her surgeries, and...

455
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:18,384
the washcloth turned orange
with all the iodine, and...

456
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:22,688
Janet said that Mom looked
like an orange Oompa Loompa.

457
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,144
And my mom couldn't stop laughing

458
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:30,630
even though it hurt
because of all the stitches.

459
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,066
I spent way too much time

460
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:36,068
in hospitals when I was a kid, so yes,

461
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,478
I do... I hate them.

462
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,810
But Janet was kind.

463
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:46,266
I never would have wanted Albany
to take care of my mom.

464
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay. We'll look at everybody
in the hospital,

465
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:52,502
starting with Nurse Albany.

466
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:57,056
Elizabeth Needham?

467
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,258
I have something for you.

468
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,062
You've just been served.

469
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:11,103
The trainer I met in the park...

470
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:13,272
he's suing me for personal injury.

471
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:15,741
- What?
- He says I intentionally hurt him.

472
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,610
But he approached me.

473
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:19,612
He wants compensatory
and punitive damages?

474
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:22,031
Look, don't worry. Talk to Andy.

475
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,950
Your husband owns a bar.
You think I need a drink?

476
00:19:23,952 --> 00:19:25,002
Well, it wouldn't hurt.

477
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:26,953
But Andy used to work
for a fancy law firm.

478
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:28,120
I bet he can help.

479
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:29,622
Tox report came back.

480
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:31,629
Theo died of a morphine overdose.

481
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:33,466
Nurse Albany is the one who hooked him up

482
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:34,534
to that morphine drip.

483
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:36,429
And she's on administrative review.

484
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:38,130
You may be right.

485
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:40,132
And if Albany is the angel of death,

486
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,934
the killing isn't gonna stop.

487
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,844
There's Dr. Walters.

488
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:14,439
They're working together?

489
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:17,202
Come on.

490
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,400
Boy.

491
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:01,853
I hope you're both going to
scrub thoroughly after this.

492
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:07,109
So, what, you gonna
arrest us for a quickie?

493
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:10,779
What do you know about the
unexplained deaths in the E.R.?

494
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:13,782
Hannah, tell them what you think.

495
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:16,785
There is a problem at Crosstown General,

496
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:18,954
and it isn't with the staff.

497
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:21,290
It's with the administrator.

498
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:24,343
The only thing admin cares about
is their financial bottom line.

499
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,094
That is what's killing patients.

500
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:28,880
- Meaning what?
- I'm doing the work of four nurses.

501
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:30,599
Unless a patient has
top-tier health insurance,

502
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:32,551
I'm barely allowed to spend
three minutes with them.

503
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:36,521
Reilly is on my butt, saying,
"Treat 'em and street 'em."

504
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:37,806
Reilly's the administrator.

505
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:40,309
He wants us to turn over
the beds as fast as possible.

506
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:42,068
I have complained a lot.

507
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,779
Which is the real reason he put her

508
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,480
on administrative review.

509
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:47,699
Reilly's trying to shut you up?

510
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:51,787
What exactly did you complain about?

511
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:58,243
For starters, the I.V. pumps
keep malfunctioning.

512
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:02,798
They go down, and no one
can tell how or why.

513
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,051
Why did that service dog

514
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,225
start barking?

515
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:09,004
Code blue in the E.R.

516
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:10,422
Code blue in Emergency.

517
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:15,955
The I.V. pumps you
complained to Reilly about...

518
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:17,982
was Theo Burton hooked up to one of them?

519
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:19,231
Yeah.

520
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:21,940
It got sent to the
machine room to be fixed.

521
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:24,236
If you wait two weeks,
it'll be back on the floor.

522
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:26,571
- I'd like to see one now.
- Good luck.

523
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:28,325
Everything's locked up down there.

524
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:29,858
They don't want anyone
getting near that stuff.

525
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,159
Why not?

526
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:33,862
Your suspect is not the first person

527
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:35,947
that Crosstown Hospital murdered.

528
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,418
Nurse Albany, are you the one who called

529
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,749
and tipped us off?

530
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:42,838
"Your suspect is not the first person.

531
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,185
Crosstown Hospital has murdered "".

532
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:47,209
Those were almost identical

533
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:48,593
to the words the whistle-blower used.

534
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:50,379
I don't think that's a coincidence.

535
00:22:51,932 --> 00:22:54,716
I tried to get
the administration to change,

536
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,351
but they won't.

537
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:58,244
Me? I'm powerless.

538
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:01,653
I was hoping you might
do the right thing.

539
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:04,716
Okay. Thank you.

540
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:05,952
You can go.

541
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:10,866
So, what do you want to do?

542
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:12,567
We're not breaking into the machine room.

543
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:14,202
No.

544
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:16,164
No, we're not.

545
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:20,992
Andy, I don't get it.

546
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:22,878
How could this guy, Jeff,

547
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,714
who was flirting with me,
turn around and sue me?

548
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:28,717
I gave up trying to understand
why people do things.

549
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,168
Dylan's the psychologist.

550
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,837
That's his sweet spot.

551
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,588
I'm only an attorney.

552
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,400
You two definitely are one of
those opposites-attract couples.

553
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:42,656
That's true, though I'm not sure
anyone is really like Dylan.

554
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:46,202
Andy, this guy, Jeff, totally tricked me.

555
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:48,012
I promise everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

556
00:23:48,014 --> 00:23:48,979
Take a breath.

557
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:50,532
Tell me what happened.

558
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:53,158
He was standing behind me, and I...

559
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,435
I guess I hit him with a dumbbell.

560
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:56,445
I didn't know that...

561
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:58,113
How'd you know he was behind you?

562
00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:00,282
Because I could feel him
breathing down my neck.

563
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:01,666
So you were annoyed at him.

564
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:03,118
Maybe that's why
you intentionally hit him.

565
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,703
I didn't intentionally hit him.
I told you, I...

566
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:07,255
- Seems you have a temper.
- I don't have a temper.

567
00:24:07,257 --> 00:24:09,124
- I...
- You sure?

568
00:24:10,454 --> 00:24:11,773
You're testing me.

569
00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:15,714
This is a "he said, she said" case,

570
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:18,133
which means it's all about
likability here, all right?

571
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:19,885
There's no witnesses, so your...

572
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:22,304
your tone is gonna be vitally important.

573
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:24,523
So, the fact that I'm telling
the truth and he's lying...

574
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:25,891
Come on, you know how it is.

575
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:27,559
The system is built in such a way

576
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,277
that the truth doesn't always win out.

577
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:32,781
I'll look into it for you.

578
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,987
Thank you, Detective.

579
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,143
Between the cold and the stench,

580
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:04,095
you owe me double for this.

581
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:06,264
So, what exactly am I doing here?

582
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:08,906
Right before Theo Burton O.D.'d,

583
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,117
a Chihuahua barked at an I.V. pump.

584
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,321
And dogs can hear things
that humans can't.

585
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:15,323
So, why did the little dog bark?

586
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:16,608
Well, that's what I hope

587
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,693
you're going to help me figure out.

588
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:36,795
Yo, step off, man.

589
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:39,464
I am stepping off. Many apologies.

590
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:24,759
The place where old machines
and fresh evidence go to die.

591
00:26:25,378 --> 00:26:26,645
These I.V. pumps aren't connected

592
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:28,346
to the Internet or Wi-Fi,

593
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:29,931
so what are you...?

594
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:38,273
Your killer reversed the
polarity of the magnet

595
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:40,575
inside that pump's speaker.

596
00:26:40,577 --> 00:26:42,410
What, turning it into a device

597
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:45,330
that listens for sound
instead of creating it?

598
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:47,782
Yes, and that machine was hacked.

599
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:51,252
They used sound to reprogram a pump?

600
00:26:51,254 --> 00:26:53,906
The killer used
an inaudible sound frequency

601
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,399
to deliver the malware.

602
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:56,508
How?

603
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,628
My guess is something
as simple as a cell phone

604
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,880
was used to trigger the attacks,

605
00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:04,003
enabling whoever did this to work

606
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:05,884
on the fly, unnoticed.

607
00:27:05,886 --> 00:27:08,470
And make them more difficult to find.

608
00:27:08,472 --> 00:27:11,940
So, could we bait the hacker,

609
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,108
draw them out?

610
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,726
We can try.

611
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:17,730
I'll ping the malware server
and send a message.

612
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:19,899
Compliment the sophistication
of their code

613
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:22,122
and propose a partnership.

614
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:24,787
Someone is transforming medical devices

615
00:27:25,255 --> 00:27:27,456
into murder weapons.

616
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:40,103
The malware attacked
the I.V. machine's pump,

617
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,328
causing it to dump huge amounts of drugs

618
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,797
into those poor patients' systems.

619
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,383
So a tech genius is our angel of death?

620
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:48,718
Didn't you say that Derek...

621
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,303
Was in the process of launching

622
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,254
an online startup when Vanessa got sick.

623
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,557
So yes, he has the computer know-how.

624
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,175
Certainly has the motive.

625
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:59,011
He did show signs
of depression and stifled rage.

626
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,429
But if he were caught,

627
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:01,742
there'd be no one to
take care of Vanessa.

628
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:04,517
He seemed incredibly devoted.

629
00:28:07,238 --> 00:28:09,488
A list of recent deaths
at Crosstown E.R.,

630
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,158
along with patient background info.

631
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,943
Where'd you get this?

632
00:28:13,945 --> 00:28:15,301
Don't ask.

633
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,414
So, apart from
being killed by an I.V. pump,

634
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,296
did these patients
have anything else in common?

635
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,501
Almost all of them had inadequate

636
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:23,748
or no health insurance.

637
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:25,632
That fits with what I dug up on Reilly.

638
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:28,256
Crosstown's administration
has their bonuses tied

639
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:29,502
to the hospital's stock price.

640
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:31,838
A good incentive
to keep earnings high.

641
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,341
Which would make him keep
patients' deaths quiet.

642
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:36,009
Do you really think Reilly

643
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,511
would intentionally murder patients?

644
00:28:38,513 --> 00:28:39,896
He's a businessman.

645
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,765
That is bad business.

646
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:49,364
I'm setting up a rendezvous

647
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:50,991
with the hacker,
letting 'em know there are

648
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:53,276
other hospitals that need
to be brought to justice

649
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:54,944
for mistreating patients.

650
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:02,702
I'll be in your ear.

651
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:04,120
Remember, it's not enough for the hacker

652
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:05,872
to admit to designing the malware.

653
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:08,008
- He has to...
- We need a confession that the malware

654
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,043
was intentionally used to kill. I know.

655
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,344
How's the level?

656
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:13,513
Hey, Needham.

657
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:14,881
Knock 'em dead.

658
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,217
Hopefully, it won't come to that.

659
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:58,391
Someone's approaching.

660
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,067
It's Becca.

661
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:09,936
Becca? This is the tech reporter I met.

662
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:15,275
I used to be a Web programmer.

663
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:17,110
Ask her if she works with a group

664
00:30:17,112 --> 00:30:19,112
or if she scripts malware on her own.

665
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:20,697
Do you work with a group

666
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:23,032
or script malware on your own?

667
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:24,451
I work alone.

668
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:26,669
You said you had a proposition for me?

669
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,705
Your malware's genius.

670
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:31,591
I'm interested in teaming up.

671
00:30:32,901 --> 00:30:34,344
Offer her money.

672
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:36,096
I would make it worth your while,

673
00:30:36,098 --> 00:30:37,464
monetarily speaking.

674
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,266
This isn't about the money.

675
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,887
If I were to use malware
to attack Crosstown General

676
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:46,857
or any other hospital like it,
I wouldn't do it for money.

677
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:49,976
I'd do it to expose their greed.

678
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:52,187
I'd bring them all down.

679
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:56,149
What made you get involved in this cause?

680
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:00,069
Why are you really here?

681
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,478
Make it personal.

682
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,865
You're onto me.

683
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:10,830
Actually, this is personal.

684
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,250
Tell her you watched your mom
die in an E.R.

685
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:18,505
I watched my mom die in an E.R.

686
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:23,426
The doctor took me to an empty room

687
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:25,645
and told me there was nothing more

688
00:31:25,647 --> 00:31:27,353
that he could do to help her.

689
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,817
But the real reason was because
my mom wasn't a priority.

690
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:35,071
But the real reason was
that my mom wasn't a priority.

691
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:36,689
He practically wanted her to die.

692
00:31:36,691 --> 00:31:39,526
He practically wanted her to die.

693
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,194
Who did?

694
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:43,029
Dad.

695
00:31:45,342 --> 00:31:47,092
The doctor.

696
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:50,370
Tell her you didn't want
to give up on your mom.

697
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:53,070
I never wanted to give up on her,

698
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:56,009
but the doctor was too busy to care.

699
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,640
I hate hospitals.

700
00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:59,379
We trust them to take care of us,

701
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:01,431
but what are we supposed to do

702
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:04,384
when they kill our loved
ones and cover it up?

703
00:32:07,304 --> 00:32:08,638
If you and I were to team up...

704
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,190
We could really do something.

705
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:22,068
Come on, Becca.

706
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,204
Confess.

707
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,543
Okay, let's do it.

708
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,746
Big attack.

709
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:36,666
We could take down every
corrupt hospital in Manhattan.

710
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,888
Meet me here at noon tomorrow.

711
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:45,258
So, this is personal for you, too?

712
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,393
For me?

713
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:49,395
No.

714
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:51,848
For me, it's political.

715
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,494
Okay, let's bring the lieutenant
up to speed

716
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,162
and get a team in place for tomorrow.

717
00:33:06,164 --> 00:33:08,331
Tell her we'll need
a few undercovers as well.

718
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,083
She's lying. We should bring her in.

719
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:11,334
She didn't confess,

720
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:12,752
but she implicated herself.

721
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:15,088
Dylan, we can't cuff Becca
with just this.

722
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,458
No, she's lying about this being
political and not personal.

723
00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:25,098
There's something else going on.

724
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:29,802
"Wedding announcement."

725
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:33,856
Becca was in the process
of planning a wedding.

726
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:35,892
She wore an engagement ring.

727
00:33:36,978 --> 00:33:38,811
I think Becca's fiancé might be

728
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:41,314
on this list of patients
who died in the E.R.

729
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:44,721
Let me see if I can find out
who she was engaged to.

730
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:47,570
If this is personal for Becca...

731
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:48,988
And she knows we're onto her,

732
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,657
she may go straight to the hospital

733
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:53,409
to get revenge on the people
who killed her fiancé.

734
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:54,794
Her fiancé died.

735
00:33:55,497 --> 00:33:56,497
At Crosstown.

736
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,449
We gotta get to the hospital now.

737
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:20,574
Don't move.

738
00:34:20,576 --> 00:34:23,022
- Police. Police.
- Everyone, give this woman space.

739
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:26,426
- Becca...
- Leave me alone.

740
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:30,117
I know what happened to your fiancé.

741
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,499
This hospital took Carl from you.

742
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:38,757
He should never have died in this E.R.

743
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:40,956
You don't get it.

744
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,629
Carl was everything.

745
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:45,299
And now it feels like half
of you is missing.

746
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:46,852
I get it.

747
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:50,808
I lost the love of my life, too.

748
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,555
After he died, I...

749
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,565
I couldn't function.

750
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:06,069
Then, one day, I stopped crying.

751
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,839
I got angry.

752
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:10,324
You wanted justice.

753
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:17,498
I'm not a killer.

754
00:35:19,668 --> 00:35:21,051
They made me this way.

755
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:22,302
It's their fault.

756
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:24,254
This hospital killed him!

757
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,557
- And they will be punished.
- No.

758
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,592
They're too big. They're too powerful.

759
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:29,843
They'll get away with it.

760
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:31,512
What if they don't?

761
00:35:33,104 --> 00:35:37,017
Becca, I know this hospital misdiagnosed

762
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:38,485
your fiancé's illness

763
00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:39,953
and Vanessa's illness.

764
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:43,184
And I have proof
they tried to cover it up.

765
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:47,444
How?

766
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,162
Institutions are very powerful,

767
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:51,532
but they're also very bureaucratic.

768
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:53,784
They keep records of everything.

769
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:55,919
I tried to get those records.

770
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,789
I sued to get those records.

771
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,674
I used other means.

772
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:07,714
You will pay a heavy price,
but you will have your justice.

773
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:29,486
It's okay.

774
00:36:30,372 --> 00:36:32,239
It's okay.

775
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:36,577
Come here. It's okay.

776
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:42,249
The hospital has already begun

777
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:44,334
the paperwork for settling your case.

778
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,003
With the money, I'll be able to get

779
00:36:46,005 --> 00:36:47,888
much better care for Vanessa.

780
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,640
And there's some new
research on the effects

781
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:52,092
of music therapy for stroke survivors.

782
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:53,510
Under a neurologist's supervision

783
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:55,429
and with proper rehab,

784
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:57,738
Vanessa could show signs of improvement.

785
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:01,370
Thank you.

786
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:03,904
Of course.

787
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:07,741
You two closed that case quickly.

788
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:08,992
Good work.

789
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:10,661
I'm turning my case folder over

790
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:11,697
to the attorney general.

791
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:14,114
Crosstown Hospital's being investigated.

792
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:16,867
Can I ask who gave you the proof

793
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,703
about Vanessa's misdiagnosis
and Becca's fiancé?

794
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,205
Yes, you can ask.

795
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:28,211
Too bad Becca made all the wrong choices.

796
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,880
You feel bad for her.

797
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:31,131
I do.

798
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:32,466
Detective, you did forget

799
00:37:32,468 --> 00:37:34,267
to put one thing in the report.

800
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:35,802
I did? I don't think so.

801
00:37:35,804 --> 00:37:37,771
Yeah, you forgot to report your overtime.

802
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:39,139
According to hospital records,

803
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:40,641
you signed in around midnight,

804
00:37:40,643 --> 00:37:43,610
I assume to get to one
of the compromised machines?

805
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:45,797
Right.

806
00:37:50,653 --> 00:37:53,320
Give me back my dupe shield now.

807
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:55,072
I really need a badge.

808
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:56,352
- You can get a badge.
- I can?

809
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:57,991
- Yeah.
- When?

810
00:37:57,993 --> 00:38:00,961
Right after you graduate
from the police academy.

811
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:08,218
You're a public servant,

812
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,337
so we don't want to drag you to court.

813
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:12,806
So my client is willing
to settle this case

814
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:15,509
right here today for,
say, a hundred thousand.

815
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:17,177
A hundred thousand dollars?

816
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:22,015
For bruising your ego?

817
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,374
I don't have a hundred thousand dollars.

818
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:28,155
Here's what I'm gonna do.

819
00:38:28,157 --> 00:38:31,062
I'm gonna set you up on
a nice payment plan.

820
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,781
Forgive my tardiness,
gentlemen, Ms. Needham.

821
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:40,033
I'm coming from a board meeting downtown.

822
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:44,588
That's your firm?

823
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,039
Voted one of the Top Ten.

824
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,457
Most Prestigious Law Firms in America.

825
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:49,292
- Yeah, I read about that.
- Okay, look.

826
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:51,128
I have to be at an
event in 30 minutes,

827
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,060
so I'm gonna need to keep this brief.

828
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:54,881
Your client, Jeff Johnson, has obscenely

829
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:56,049
exaggerated his injuries.

830
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,018
And, Mr. Traub, your naked grab

831
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,686
for excessive monetary damages

832
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:01,555
has so upset my client
and personal friend

833
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:03,023
that I have decided to countersue

834
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:04,441
on Ms. Needham's behalf.

835
00:39:08,564 --> 00:39:10,363
- They dropped the lawsuit.
- Yay!

836
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:13,483
Turns out Jeff has done
this a dozen times before.

837
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,702
It's a scam he's got down cold.

838
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:18,071
Also happens to be
Traub's brother-in-law.

839
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:19,906
So they're keeping it in the family.

840
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,374
Well, well done.

841
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:23,744
Also, you look mighty fine
in that suit, sir.

842
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:26,246
Forgot how much
I hate putting these on.

843
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:28,048
I was lucky to have you, Andy.

844
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,083
If you hadn't been there,
Traub would've buried me.

845
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:31,289
Thank you.

846
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:34,221
Just glad my law degree
came in handy for someone.

847
00:39:34,223 --> 00:39:37,307
Vanessa and Derek had no one
to stand up for them.

848
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:39,559
- Neither did Becca.
- No.

849
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:41,561
Fighting a losing battle
against a Goliath

850
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:43,680
just pushed her over the edge.

851
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,265
Those Goliaths can be vicious.

852
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:46,767
They certainly can.

853
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:48,518
You just gotta find a bigger Goliath.

854
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,020
Is this what you guys
talk about when you're

855
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:51,605
alone together all day... Goliaths?

856
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,190
'Cause I've had my
moments of being jealous

857
00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:54,608
in the past, but not so much anymore.

858
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,693
I told you, police work is boring.

859
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,613
Yeah, especially since
I've been working with Dylan.

860
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:18,511

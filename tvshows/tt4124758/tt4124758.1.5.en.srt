1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,588
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

2
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:06,893
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,836
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

4
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:10,736
I became Professor Reinhart.

5
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:13,155
I wrote a book about
abnormal behavior in criminals,

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,479
which was so successful,

7
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,215
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

8
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:20,085
That's when the New York Police
Department reached out to me

9
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,853
to help catch him, which I did.

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,867
So they hired me, and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,791
So now I'm working with this woman,

12
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,927
Detective Lizzie Needham
of the homicide division,

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,592
catching killers.

14
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:32,159
Looks like I need a new name.

15
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:34,194
Don't they call you Professor Psychopath?

16
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,240
- Hey, it's me.
- Hey.

17
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:41,698
I-I need a favor,
and you're not gonna like it.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,665
What now?

19
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,501
Tell Dad I can't meet.

20
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,937
Tell him I have a test
and, I need to study.

21
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,006
Why? What's going on?

22
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,175
Don't worry. I promise I'll...

23
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,410
tell him what's going on soon.

24
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:55,612
What's going on? Are you okay?

25
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:56,746
Love you.

26
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,748
I love you.

27
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:05,155
We have a homicide by drowning, possibly.

28
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:16,032
Just brought in a
female Caucasian, mid-40s.

29
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:26,676
Good morning, my assembled prodigies.

30
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:30,613
All you former class presidents
and valedictorians,

31
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:34,384
all you type A go-getters
and relentless overachievers.

32
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,519
If you're here for Abnormal Behavior

33
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:39,422
or Intro to Psychopaths,
you've come to the right spot.

34
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,392
If not, now would be a good time
to escape. Any questions?

35
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,663
Yes? What's your name?

36
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:48,565
- Phoebe.
- Okay, Phoebe.

37
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,866
Asking if there were any questions

38
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,668
was kind of a rhetorical question,

39
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,837
because I haven't actually
taught you anything yet today,

40
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,171
so there shouldn't be any need

41
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:57,140
- to ask anything.
- Sorry.

42
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:58,227
No.

43
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:02,278
Psychopaths make up one percent
of the population,

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,414
which means there are two of them

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,950
in this classroom right now.

46
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,985
Maybe sitting right next to you.

47
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:12,522
In a university of 16,000 students,

48
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:16,493
that means there are 160 psychopaths

49
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:20,363
roaming the campus at any given time.

50
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:22,599
Enjoy your walk to lunch.

51
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:27,629
_

52
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,110
I've studied killers
who have amputated limbs,

53
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,546
removed eyeballs,
even an entire lung once,

54
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:37,714
but a heart?

55
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:39,449
What kind of person removes a heart?

56
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,384
Someone without one of their own?

57
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,586
Killer whales prey on great white sharks

58
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:45,588
off of South Africa, and get this...

59
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,091
the sharks have their livers
and hearts removed

60
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,393
by the whales
with almost surgical precision.

61
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:52,262
Whereas human predatory techniques

62
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,030
don't develop because of hunger.

63
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:55,365
So, the killer is an orca?

64
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,033
Is that the takeaway from your story?

65
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:58,501
The other ambulances are clear.

66
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,271
Jane Doe isn't only missing her heart.

67
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:03,573
No wallet, no phone, no I.D.

68
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:05,915
Why would anyone steal a heart?

69
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,310
Black market organ ring?

70
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,512
People may pay for
hearts in the U.S.;

71
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:11,181
They tend to go overseas to get 'em.

72
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:13,383
Last night, it was 80 degrees.

73
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:15,418
Hardly leather jacket weather.

74
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,021
Maybe it was new and
she was showing it off,

75
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,556
or maybe it wasn't hers.

76
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,724
The jacket isn't cheap,
but her jeans and shoes

77
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:23,459
look low-rent.

78
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,964
That's a Gemma Kadin.

79
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,766
A designer downtown.

80
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:36,506
That is a great suit.

81
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,607
Thank you.

82
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:38,675
Tom Ford, 2016?

83
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,143
Marshalls, last month.

84
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:41,911
Detective Needham.

85
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:43,913
I need the name of the customer

86
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:45,848
who purchased a number three
in this jacket.

87
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,849
Yes, of course.

88
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,151
I'll get that for you.

89
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:50,853
We are literally the fashion police.

90
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,063
So, the jacket was
purchased by Frank Fallon

91
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,339
on April 6.

92
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:58,555
I delivered it to his daughter, Maggie.

93
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:05,868
I have to warn you,
this picture is graphic.

94
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,071
Is this Maggie?

95
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,808
Yes, that's her.

96
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,643
Mr. Fallon?

97
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:16,312
I'm Detective Needham.
This is Dylan Reinhart.

98
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,097
Your office told us you'd be here.

99
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,817
Yeah, I eat here every day.
Here, sit down. Join me.

100
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,754
Onishi! Two more Onishi
rolls for my friends here.

101
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:26,723
Best sushi chef in New York City.

102
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:31,294
Um, is there somewhere
we can talk in private?

103
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:34,864
There has been an incident
regarding your daughter, Maggie.

104
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:41,304
I was supposed to see her Friday.

105
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:44,240
We eat lunch here every Friday.

106
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:49,946
Mr. Fallon, we're gonna
need you to identify her.

107
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:51,914
You mean to look at her?

108
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,777
No, I can't.

109
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,819
Okay. Okay.

110
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:59,956
How about we go
by Maggie's apartment first?

111
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:03,926
Dad?

112
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,480
Maggie. Maggie, Maggie!

113
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:07,930
What are you doing here?

114
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,400
You took the words right out of my mouth.

115
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:20,170
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

116
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,203
Her name's Amy. Amy Jenkins.

117
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,205
How do you know Amy?

118
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:34,226
We met online after she saw
my post on Stay B and C.

119
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,117
She was flying in from Ohio for the week,

120
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,453
wanted to rent out
my spare bedroom, but...

121
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:40,722
why is she wearing my jacket?

122
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,742
She obviously stole it.

123
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,009
Did Amy mention any friends,

124
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,644
family she was here to see?

125
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:46,879
She said she didn't know anyone.

126
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,281
How about any places she wanted to go?

127
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:51,151
She came in late.

128
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:52,986
I gave her a key,
and I never saw her again.

129
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,254
I can't believe you're still

130
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,728
renting your room to strangers.

131
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,257
I'm paying it forward.

132
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,725
I have so much.

133
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,472
Thanks to my father.
He'd do anything for me.

134
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,296
She rents a room on one of these websites

135
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:04,975
but ends up giving the money back

136
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:06,349
to the kids in need.

137
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:09,069
I can't believe she's dead.

138
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:10,970
I'll need to see Amy's
Stay B and C profile,

139
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:12,372
any of her things, as well as

140
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:14,507
all the e-mails exchanged
between you two.

141
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,610
Psst!

142
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,380
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

143
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,176
Something isn't adding up.

144
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,678
This murder is way too personal.

145
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,100
If Amy didn't know
anybody in New York City,

146
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:29,735
why would a stranger want
to cut out her heart?

147
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:32,872
They do look similar... which explains
why the shopgirl made a bad I.D.

148
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:34,621
And the cross-race effect.

149
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:37,762
People of one race often
misidentify people of other races.

150
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,261
The chances of a mistaken I.D.
go up about 50%.

151
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:43,463
So maybe they were after Maggie
and got Amy instead.

152
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:44,591
They look alike.

153
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:46,664
She was wearing her jacket,
staying in her place.

154
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,537
The question is... why would
someone want Maggie dead?

155
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,876
Found it.

156
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:57,978
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

157
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:02,315
Somebody's been showing you
some unwanted attention.

158
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm guessing, inside that cellophane,

159
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:05,629
there are some flowers.

160
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:07,315
And judging by the...

161
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:09,984
faint whiff of rhodinol and sour milk,

162
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:13,587
I'm going to guess roses
and baby's breath.

163
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:15,122
Thank you.

164
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,726
No one throws away fresh flowers.

165
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:22,096
Unless they didn't want them
in the first place.

166
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:25,232
You recently installed two
new locks on your front door.

167
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:28,002
Or your painters did
a superb job everywhere

168
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:30,938
except for the area around your locks.

169
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,486
The shades on your windows are bottom up,

170
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:34,426
suggesting you don't want anyone
on the street

171
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:36,777
seeing into your loft. Maggie...

172
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:39,747
Do you have a stalker?

173
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:41,949
What?

174
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,169
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've handled it.

175
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,153
That's why I didn't tell you.

176
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:47,454
I knew you'd go crazy.

177
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:48,856
Do you know your stalker?

178
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:50,427
I've never seen him.

179
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,409
Does he send you anything
other than flowers?

180
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,387
He sends photos.

181
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:55,954
I complained
to the local precinct last week

182
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,022
and gave them the pictures.

183
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:58,523
Pictures of what?

184
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,191
Me.

185
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:04,462
Was it my heart he was after?

186
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:06,831
Did you notice how the dad,

187
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,166
who looks like a shark, didn't react

188
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:10,001
when two cops showed up to talk to him?

189
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,369
You're not a cop.

190
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,309
Hey. I'm cop-ish.

191
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,153
I'll check if he has a record.

192
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,289
I never would have thought

193
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,823
that guy would be such a loving father

194
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:19,458
after getting a look at his pinky ring.

195
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,660
I guess you can't judge
a man by his pinky ring.

196
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:22,928
Yes, you can.

197
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,396
It's a guy with a pinky ring.

198
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:26,231
Can we stop talking about pinky rings

199
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,766
and go and find our stalker?

200
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,634
Follow me.

201
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,713
Wow. Nice Harley.

202
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:42,948
It's Detective Fucci's.

203
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,016
He loves it more than his children.

204
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,137
Much more.

205
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,453
The precinct where Maggie
filed her stalker report

206
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:49,729
is going to e-mail the photos.

207
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,124
Don't tell anyone to
follow you ever again.

208
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,925
I'm surprised you weren't pulled over.

209
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:57,262
As your boss, all I can say is...
get used to it.

210
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:58,563
Boss?

211
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:01,407
You should know I have a
thing with authority.

212
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,769
Then I'm ordering you to get over it.

213
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:11,910
Lieutenant Gooden, um,
just out of curiosity,

214
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:13,852
when do I get one of those
permits that allows me

215
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,763
- to park wherever I want?
- He's joking.

216
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,016
No... no, I'm not. I'd really like one.

217
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:21,520
And we got Maggie's photos

218
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,789
from the 21st, the local precinct.

219
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,991
I think we found our stalker.

220
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:28,466
They're taken over a period of six weeks,

221
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,164
but all from the same vantage point.

222
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:32,199
He's got to live or work there.

223
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:33,467
And you're sure there's only one.

224
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,135
Caldo Freddo coffee in Manhattan?

225
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:37,437
Yeah, it's where Andy
buys all our coffee.

226
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,139
My bike... I...

227
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:41,481
I-I parked it just there.

228
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:43,376
How did it...

229
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:45,712
Idiots.

230
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,080
I see.

231
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:48,648
- I'm being hazed.
- I'll talk to 'em.

232
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,684
No, don't. It's a necessary ritual.

233
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:52,352
If they see that it bothers me,

234
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:54,120
it'll only encourage them
to do something worse.

235
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:56,823
Don't worry, they'll do
something worse regardless.

236
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,659
Climb in. We're going to the same place.

237
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,900
- Are you serious?
- Very.

238
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:09,202
Okay, you got to consult the dad.

239
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:11,404
- I get this guy.
- Rookie, it's not a barter system.

240
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,240
No, it's a partnership...
and partners compromise,

241
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:14,674
as my husband keeps telling me.

242
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:17,344
Excuse me. Do you know this woman?

243
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:18,643
No.

244
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:21,781
If we find the stalker, I'll bait him.

245
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:23,766
See if he gets angry, how it escalates.

246
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:25,952
See if he has it in him to
cut out someone's heart.

247
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:27,120
I know what “bait” means.

248
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:28,989
Do you know this woman?

249
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,357
No, sorry.

250
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:42,068
Same angle as the photos.
Hi. I'm Detective Needham.

251
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,771
I need to speak with you
about this woman.

252
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,375
I got this.

253
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:53,804
Okay, okay. Just... just give me a sec.

254
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,949
Not a good idea to run from the police.

255
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:58,184
My therapist says I have
impulse control issues.

256
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:59,486
And you admit that to the police?

257
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:01,521
- Nice flower stand.
- Is that where

258
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:03,165
you got the roses you sent Maggie?

259
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:04,791
Yeah, but please don't tell my boss.

260
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:06,560
So you admit you stalk her?

261
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:07,594
Yeah.

262
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:08,662
You're really not good at this.

263
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:09,996
Did you know that Maggie threw out

264
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:11,064
the roses you gave her?

265
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:12,332
And that she has a new boyfriend?

266
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,234
I guess it was just a matter of time,

267
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:15,569
her being so beautiful.

268
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:17,871
Who's she?

269
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:19,573
- Maybe you thought it was Maggie.
- No, no, no.

270
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:20,774
That woman looks nothing like Maggie.

271
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,009
See...

272
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,912
I must have cut myself.

273
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:27,450
I might...

274
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:28,843
I might vomit.

275
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:31,318
- You can go.
- No.

276
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,953
You can't.

277
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:36,256
I'm confused. Um, can I go?

278
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:37,557
Or do I...

279
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,392
I just forwarded myself your contact info

280
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:42,028
and deleted Maggie's information
and all your photos.

281
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,364
The stalking ends now, or I'll make sure

282
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:46,533
you're never able to hold a knife again,

283
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:48,566
let alone cut flowers.

284
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:51,048
You're giving me
your number. That's cool.

285
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,872
It's the number of a police psychologist.

286
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:54,708
If you don't call him by tomorrow,

287
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,976
I'll be back.

288
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:58,178
Now you can go.

289
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,600
Thanks for letting me handle that.

290
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:04,669
Handle? You were about
to just let him go.

291
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:06,738
He was about to faint
over a drop of blood.

292
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,534
There was no way he could have
cut out a human heart.

293
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:10,580
I know. I just like to make sure.

294
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:11,526
Why?

295
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,108
Because he...

296
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:15,476
I'm your boss. I don't need
to explain myself to you.

297
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:16,744
Fair enough.

298
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,846
One question, boss... do we get to eat?

299
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,214
Sure. Right after we catch

300
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:22,316
whoever cut out that woman's heart.

301
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,185
Actually, I'm starving.

302
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,622
Lizzie, you want anything else?

303
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:28,990
No, thank you, Andy.

304
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:31,025
It was so good.

305
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:32,460
I love your bar.

306
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,030
Actually, if you could tell your
husband to pick up his pace

307
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:38,736
before I stick this fork
in the back of my hand.

308
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:40,635
It takes approximately 20 minutes

309
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:42,203
from starting to eat for the brain

310
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:43,838
to send signals of fullness.

311
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,140
We should chew each bite
until it liquefies

312
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:49,644
or loses texture before swallowing.

313
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,946
Yes, he's like this at home.

314
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,215
- I'm so sorry.
- Telling you, if you can

315
00:12:54,217 --> 00:12:57,985
handle Dylan, there is no killer
you can't catch.

316
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,892
- What, is the M.E. ready?
- I don't know.

317
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:07,061
I just don't feel like waiting anymore.

318
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:15,102
Bye, I guess.

319
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,604
Bye.

320
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:24,303
Doug?

321
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,180
Doug!

322
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:31,152
I'm trying to overcome negative minds.

323
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:33,221
- Can you come back?
- No.

324
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,991
The vic showed no signs of strangulation,

325
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,526
no defensive wounds,

326
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:39,862
no signs of struggle.

327
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:42,296
I found no injection marks,
which is consistent

328
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:43,764
with the initial tox screen that said

329
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:45,233
there are no drugs in the system.

330
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:47,058
So, why was she killed?

331
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,265
The motive for most murders is
either greed, love or pride.

332
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:53,107
Do you really believe
the enormity of human behavior

333
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:55,676
can fit into three categories? Ha!

334
00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:57,645
Maybe you should try meditation, too.

335
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:59,180
It increases the cortical thickness

336
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:00,915
of the hippocampus,
which governs learning,

337
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,551
and it decreases the brain cell
volume in the amygdala,

338
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:06,721
which governs, fear,
anxiety and stress,

339
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,923
which can lead
to overly simplistic theories.

340
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,458
Okay.

341
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,526
Did you have any luck on
the fingerprint in AFIS?

342
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:14,003
No.

343
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,492
Distract him.

344
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,175
What?

345
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:20,935
Distract him.

346
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:23,104
Why? No. Do it.

347
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:30,863
So, you meditate?

348
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:32,480
When I'm not being interrupted.

349
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:34,815
I, um... I thought about meditating.

350
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:37,977
I hear it's great for building
internal, um, energies.

351
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,635
Did you always want

352
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:41,770
to be an M.E., Doug?
I'm curious about you.

353
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:42,938
When did it occur to you,

354
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,091
“I want to cut open dead people”?

355
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,160
Was it, like, um, an aha moment

356
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:49,205
or a childhood dream?

357
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,002
- Well, you know, um, it's a long...
- Nice chatting.

358
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,436
Bye, Doug.

359
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,571
Childhood dream.

360
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,517
Don't ever do that to me again.

361
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,568
Doug's not so bad.

362
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,504
You don't need to steal
a dead woman's prints.

363
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,672
You could've asked.

364
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,031
That wouldn't be nearly so much fun.

365
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,408
Anyway, I didn't steal.

366
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,537
I borrowed.

367
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,110
- You stole.
- Look, we have

368
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,127
a dead woman no one knows.

369
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:13,613
No drugs, no struggle.

370
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:15,348
Finding out who she is may help us

371
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,916
figure out who else saw her that night.

372
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,818
I need fingerprints with no paper trail.

373
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,021
You think
your super special secret friend

374
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,690
will find a match.

375
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:25,158
Is he CIA, too?

376
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,592
My super special secret friend

377
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:29,662
can find out much more than the NYPD.

378
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,934
You playing tennis with
a really small racquet?

379
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:37,537
Shocking how you forgot,
considering I thrashed you

380
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,072
on the squash court so many times.

381
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:40,974
You wish. There's a fingerprint on this.

382
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:43,643
Belongs to a young woman
who had her heart cut out.

383
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,812
I need your help to find out who she was.

384
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,013
A shot glass?

385
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,681
Rushing a fraternity, are we?

386
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,718
Her name's Amy Jenkins...
if that is indeed her name.

387
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,086
She's not in the system...

388
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:54,620
no birth certificate, no school records.

389
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,278
We can't even alert her family.

390
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,657
Okay, Detective.

391
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:00,126
Or is it Consultant Detective?

392
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:02,667
Do you get a badge? Free doughnuts?

393
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,630
Can I press the buttons
to make the lights on the car

394
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:06,065
- go round and round?
- Are you through?

395
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,367
Clearly, you aren't.

396
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,370
It's only a matter of time

397
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,538
before you're back in the Acronym.

398
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,807
We did have fun back then, didn't we?

399
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,143
Or you could come work with me.

400
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:19,545
The wayfaring, enigmatic life

401
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,414
of the independent contractor.

402
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,850
Unallied, self-reliant.

403
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,885
It's really quite liberating.

404
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:29,155
I'm quite happy with
my life the way it is.

405
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:31,924
As a former Agency analyst,
writer, teacher,

406
00:16:31,926 --> 00:16:33,159
and now cop consultant.

407
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:35,061
Just as you dreamed when you were a kid.

408
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:36,771
I was never a kid.

409
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,867
I'll use the print to reconstruct

410
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,635
the victim's actual fingerprint,

411
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:45,038
and hack into her cell phone
provider's biometric cloud

412
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,606
of cryptographic hash signatures.

413
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,207
With a dactylogram match,

414
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,076
I can data-dump the contents of her phone

415
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,944
onto any computer desktop.

416
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:53,758
Totally.

417
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,272
Two blondes, same jacket.

418
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:20,840
Almost identical.

419
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:22,275
Did they kill the wrong one?

420
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:25,478
Why the heart?

421
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,313
Dad?

422
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:31,484
Look at you.

423
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:34,287
At the piano, immersed in a police case.

424
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,323
I remember when this room
was used for grading papers.

425
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:38,791
Or writing.

426
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:40,426
Speaking of which,
how is that book going?

427
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,829
It's not going at all.

428
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:45,064
You've been in here
for hours, playing music.

429
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:47,733
You skipped dinner. I know that look.

430
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:49,936
You get consumed by these
things, you get obsessed,

431
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,338
- and then you can't turn it off.
- Andy.

432
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:55,374
A poor woman had her heart yanked out,

433
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,977
and whoever did it is still out there.

434
00:17:57,979 --> 00:18:00,046
Yes, it's irresistible

435
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:03,049
and consuming, but that
doesn't mean I'm consumed.

436
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:08,540
When I figure out the why,
I can understand the who.

437
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:12,658
I'm sorry somebody died...
I am... but I care about you.

438
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,546
You may eat slow, but you make
big life decisions fast.

439
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,732
Before I gave notice

440
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,601
at my soul-crushing, white-shoe law firm,

441
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,836
we discussed it endlessly together.

442
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:26,432
You took this job on top
of the two you already have.

443
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:27,874
You've barely said a word about it,

444
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:29,976
and I'm afraid
the less you talk about it,

445
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:32,245
the harder it's gonna be to turn it off.

446
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,315
Okay, let's talk about it.

447
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,527
- Now? No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

448
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:40,119
Not when you're in the middle
of one of your

449
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,722
crime-fighting, beautiful-mind,
meditative states.

450
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:44,157
No, you're elsewhere. We'll...

451
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,758
we'll talk tomorrow.

452
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,008
Four graduate degrees and a doctorate.

453
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,177
How long have you been standing there?

454
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,444
Long enough.

455
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:24,646
Shouldn't be this complicated.

456
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:26,047
It isn't.

457
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:28,149
And it doesn't need to be.

458
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:31,853
We're-we're not talking
about coffee anymore.

459
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:33,888
I get that you're not a cop...
or even cop-ish...

460
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,557
but there is a way that we do things

461
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,559
around here, a way I like to do things,

462
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,160
and you need to respect that.

463
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:41,329
I do respect that.

464
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:42,630
I don't have to agree with it.

465
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:44,432
Okay, you can have your authority issues

466
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,601
and your mommy issues
and your social issues,

467
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,369
but when it comes to the work,

468
00:19:48,371 --> 00:19:50,638
the only issue that matters is the case.

469
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
Yes, the case.

470
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,709
Got it.

471
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:57,412
I've been doing just fine on my own.

472
00:19:58,055 --> 00:19:59,581
So have I.

473
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,482
The coffee machine
would suggest otherwise.

474
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,425
Hey, Doc.

475
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:12,393
How was the ride home yesterday? Good?

476
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:13,795
Good?

477
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,862
So, what are we missing?

478
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:16,364
Just a motive, a suspect,

479
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,433
and the I.D. of the victim.

480
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:20,668
Other than that, we're kicking ass.

481
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,337
Maggie's dad checked out.

482
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:23,571
His business is legit.

483
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:25,406
Mr. Pinky Ring? Not seeing a motive.

484
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:27,375
Though he does look like a shark.

485
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:29,377
When you said those whales
were devouring those sharks,

486
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:31,597
you said something
like it's “surgically exact.”

487
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,982
“Almost surgical precision”"
Her rib cage is crushed,

488
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,017
but look at the cuts
through the major vessels.

489
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,219
The aorta, the vena cava...
they're precise.

490
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:39,754
Surgically precise.

491
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,623
The killer knew his way with a knife.

492
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,758
Like a butcher or a doctor?

493
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,493
But... what, he was in a hurry?

494
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,161
Or did he just care about the heart?

495
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,664
And if so, why? Why would
someone cut out a heart?

496
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,999
You keep asking that.

497
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,503
Excuse me.

498
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,739
I tracked the victim's fingerprints.

499
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:59,340
Your vic's real name

500
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,889
is Beth Lennon, from North Dakota.

501
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:04,479
A small-town grifter
with 27 online identities,

502
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:06,714
multiple Stay B and C complaints,

503
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:09,017
and tons of college debt.

504
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:12,353
That's a text with a Web link,

505
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,389
log-in I.D. and password
which you can use

506
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:16,453
to access a portal
containing the contents

507
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:17,968
of your victim's phone.

508
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:20,662
You've got two hours
before the domain corrupts.

509
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:22,463
And one more thing...

510
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,365
Just hold on a sec.

511
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:36,377
Thanks for this. I owe you.

512
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,713
I'm keeping a tab. Before you go,

513
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,014
I found some information

514
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,716
on another matter
that might interest you.

515
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,551
- What is it?
- Not on the phone.

516
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:46,354
You're not dragging me
into any spy games.

517
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,990
Meet me at Soho House in 30.

518
00:21:55,365 --> 00:21:58,227
That “free parking permit”...
never gonna happen.

519
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,593
I was just...

520
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:20,688
How long before you think he calls AAA?

521
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:30,531
What does he think he's doing?

522
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,004
Wow.

523
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,842
What couldn't you tell me over the phone?

524
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:43,745
I did some looking
into your new work situation

525
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:46,180
with this particular NYPD homicide squad.

526
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:47,582
Of course you did.

527
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,584
I found evidence...

528
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:52,854
of an open CIA/FBI/MI6 task force

529
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:54,956
that's been investigating
a smuggling operation

530
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,457
that uses New York ports.

531
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,994
They were zeroing in
on a Detective Charles Pavlik,

532
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:03,574
when he was suddenly killed,
ostensibly in the line of duty.

533
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,666
Charlie?

534
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:07,635
You've heard of him?

535
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,072
I don't know all the details yet,

536
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:13,374
but I do know
the investigation is ongoing.

537
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:15,777
Which leads me to believe
there are others on the team

538
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,779
who may also be compromised.

539
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:19,781
Maybe Charlie's previous partner.

540
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:23,851
And his fiancée, who you know
is Detective Elizabeth Needham,

541
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:27,221
my current partner.

542
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,591
Who is certainly not dirty.

543
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:32,994
Why would you even try to
raise doubts about her?

544
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,338
I gotta go.

545
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:39,798
Do you want me to keep digging?

546
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,569
No. Even if Charlie

547
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:43,330
were corrupt, Lizzie didn't know.

548
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:44,895
You're worried about protecting her.

549
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:46,574
- Protect yourself.
- I have a pretty good record

550
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:48,376
about judging human behavior.

551
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:50,211
I may not know Lizzie well,

552
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:52,580
but trust can be instinctive,
and I trust her.

553
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,416
She is not dirty.

554
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:03,591
Whoa. Our guys really
pulled this together fast.

555
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:06,394
Look at all of our victim's
dating app traffic.

556
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:07,662
Popular girl.

557
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:09,348
Should we do this?

558
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,286
If we must.

559
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:12,893
Lock the door.

560
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:17,705
How's the new consultant?

561
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,107
Given the fact that every cop
I've partnered with

562
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:22,310
since Charlie has driven me crazy,

563
00:24:22,312 --> 00:24:23,711
I thought Dylan would be different

564
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:24,946
since he's not a cop.

565
00:24:24,948 --> 00:24:26,347
Thigh or abdomen?

566
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:27,782
Abdomen.

567
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:30,574
Well, just say the word,
and I will tell the mayor

568
00:24:30,576 --> 00:24:31,819
that Dylan's not working out.

569
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:34,655
No, it's... he's fine. Maybe it's me.

570
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:35,990
It's really a pretty small needle.

571
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,959
Don't even say that word.

572
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:42,597
I think you and David
being proactive is smart.

573
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:45,399
Fertility issues will do that.

574
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,435
You can open the door.

575
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,172
Okay, our victim's
most recent date was set

576
00:24:51,174 --> 00:24:55,309
with a “Richard P”
on the night she was murdered.

577
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,911
Yeah, I wish it were that simple.

578
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,813
She had half a dozen dating
apps, and made six dates

579
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:00,648
with six different guys
on the same night.

580
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,418
Well, then you better get busy
writing six warrant requests.

581
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,294
That could take all night.
We need to narrow it down.

582
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,923
Like, butchers, doctors,
anyone with knife skills.

583
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,778
“Dr. Damian. Adventurous,

584
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,132
“successful, loves healing people.

585
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:20,388
“Looking for a spontaneous woman,

586
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,754
ideally blonde.”

587
00:25:22,756 --> 00:25:25,773
Harris. Get me a warrant
for Date N' Chill

588
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,608
so I can find the identity
of this doctor.

589
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,676
Copy.

590
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:31,412
I don't want to wait that long.

591
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:34,115
- You have a better idea?
- Yeah.

592
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:36,551
I'm gonna do the same thing
our victim did:

593
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:40,555
Make a date with a stranger
who could rip out my heart.

594
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:50,728
Could you please not touch that?

595
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,363
What a happy coincidence
you made Lizzie come

596
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,017
to my place 'cause,
you know, New York magazine

597
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,168
just voted it “Best Bar
for Luring Crazed Murderers.”

598
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,294
Possible crazed murderers.

599
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,419
You know, I ought to call the police.

600
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:03,679
I am the police.

601
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:05,300
Hey, would you...
could you just put that down?

602
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:07,318
- But it's fun.
- Why don't you just arrest the guy?

603
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,937
Well, Lizzie's trying to draw him out,

604
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:10,117
try to get him to admit to things

605
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,199
he may not if he knew she were a cop.

606
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,867
And I'm here... making sure she's safe.

607
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,706
I think our doc is a no-show.

608
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,137
Maybe he got suspicious.

609
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:26,745
Scratch that.

610
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:30,015
- Hey.
- Hey.

611
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:31,484
Sorry I'm late.

612
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:33,152
I would've been on time if you hadn't

613
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:34,720
switched locations on me
at the last minute.

614
00:26:34,722 --> 00:26:36,255
Well, you're here now,

615
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:38,390
so get comfortable and
take a deep breath.

616
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:42,561
Wow, you're prettier than your pictures.

617
00:26:42,563 --> 00:26:44,730
- That's rare.
- Yes, I know.

618
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:46,665
I mean, not that I'm prettier,
but, you know,

619
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,267
how people lie and exaggerate.

620
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:50,402
- Really, what's the point?
- Exactly.

621
00:26:50,404 --> 00:26:52,386
Can I get a gin and tonic?

622
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,147
Top shelf.

623
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:56,675
You got gorgeous eyes.

624
00:26:57,205 --> 00:26:59,285
Are you really Serbian,
trying to get your work visa?

625
00:27:04,785 --> 00:27:06,819
What did you say?

626
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:08,120
I said, “Of course, I'm Serbian.”

627
00:27:08,122 --> 00:27:09,355
And then, um...

628
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:10,990
I asked if you're really a doctor.

629
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:12,525
I am.

630
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:13,926
What is your specialty?

631
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:15,761
Dermatologist?

632
00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:17,096
Um, pediatrician?

633
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:18,464
Surgeon?

634
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:20,099
Why, are surgeons your specialty?

635
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:24,570
I became a doctor to heal those in pain.

636
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:26,906
And I can tell, just from your energy,

637
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:29,241
you're in a lot of pain yourself.

638
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:31,043
You're not a doctor.

639
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:33,008
I happen to be the most in-demand

640
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,247
kinesiologist in all of Manhattan.

641
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:36,615
Like I said, not a doctor.

642
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:37,917
Just 'cause I didn't go to medical school

643
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,951
doesn't mean I'm not a doctor.

644
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:41,220
That is exactly what it means.

645
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:45,591
What, that's it?
You're done talking to me?

646
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:48,694
I haven't even started.

647
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,930
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

648
00:27:50,932 --> 00:27:52,198
We ate,

649
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,699
but I swear I didn't kill her.

650
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,434
I-I didn't even say good night to her.

651
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:56,802
Why is that?

652
00:27:56,804 --> 00:27:58,804
She split before the check even came.

653
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:01,507
I... She was only pretending
to be interested in me

654
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:02,875
to get a free meal. I...

655
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:04,910
And once I figured out
what she was up to,

656
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:07,313
I chased her, but I decided,
what's the point?

657
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:09,848
Thought that was
the worst date of my entire life

658
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,778
- until tonight.
- You chased her?

659
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,485
- Did you talk to her?
- No, I was like...

660
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:16,255
a block away. I let her go.

661
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:18,424
- What was I gonna say?
- Where'd you see her?

662
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:19,992
It was on Hudson Street.

663
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:22,126
- Going which direction?
- South.

664
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:24,163
- But then she turned.
- Onto?

665
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:26,131
It was a right onto Morton.

666
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:29,101
I'll have the unis cast a wide net,

667
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:31,070
see to it that all the CCTV footage

668
00:28:31,072 --> 00:28:32,938
along the route Beth took is collected.

669
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,440
How long will that take?

670
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:37,109
Hopefully, we'll have
it all by the morning.

671
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,560
So, I went to your house,
no one answered,

672
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:56,061
it's almost midnight, and I thought,

673
00:28:56,063 --> 00:28:57,863
“Where would Lizzie be?”

674
00:28:57,865 --> 00:28:59,298
Et voilà.

675
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,634
You should be a detective.

676
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:03,068
I'm trying.

677
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:05,037
If you'd let me.

678
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:09,022
I've been told I can be...

679
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:15,147
challenging, but I know
you like a challenge.

680
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:18,384
That's something we have in common.

681
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,453
That's one thing we do have in common.

682
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,656
I've been told I can be challenging, too.

683
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:25,758
Is that why you isolate
yourself from the team?

684
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,416
I don't isolate myself.

685
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,528
Okay, okay.

686
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,196
Maybe I do.

687
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,400
That's why no one wants
to partner with me.

688
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:36,135
I don't blame them.

689
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,371
- Ever since Charlie...
- They care about you.

690
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:42,708
Your detective skills are failing you.

691
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:45,934
Give me time.

692
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:49,081
I'll get there.

693
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,750
I know you will.

694
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,991
So will I.

695
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:01,927
Detective Needham...

696
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,864
will you...

697
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:08,634
show me how to use the coffee machine?

698
00:30:17,244 --> 00:30:19,578
Yes, that's why I came
all the way over here...

699
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,114
to have a conversation with your feet.

700
00:30:22,116 --> 00:30:23,882
Morning, Joan. Let yourself in.

701
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:28,887
Listen, everybody
is crazy for the new book.

702
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:30,856
Now you just have to write it.

703
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:32,558
And don't pretend
like you don't have time

704
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,026
'cause you work for the NYPD.

705
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:35,390
That's not gonna fly.

706
00:30:35,392 --> 00:30:37,563
Sure. Having less time's gonna
make it easier to write.

707
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:39,231
You know what? I should tell you...

708
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,234
Johnson and Kimball also want
to make a audiobook

709
00:30:42,236 --> 00:30:43,569
of Freaks.

710
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:45,270
Now, they gave me a whole list of,

711
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:46,305
you know, famous people,

712
00:30:46,307 --> 00:30:48,440
but I like Dame Judi Dench

713
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:49,842
and Ice-T.

714
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:53,178
I have no interest
in recording an audiobook.

715
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:55,614
I'm already wearing too many hats.

716
00:30:55,616 --> 00:30:59,051
That's why I asked them to
give you a six-month extension.

717
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:00,285
They agreed to that?

718
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:02,367
That's how much they love
the new premise.

719
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:05,583
- What new premise?
- Hot ex-CIA agent

720
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:08,660
gets in with the NYPD to solve crime.

721
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:10,195
It's gonna be much better

722
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:12,264
than the boring old book
you're not writing.

723
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:15,067
I don't want to revisit my CIA past.

724
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:17,269
That's why I retired.

725
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,199
Get on the couch.

726
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:23,642
Get on the couch.

727
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,484
What's going on?

728
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:34,209
Nothing.

729
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,423
Everything.

730
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:39,525
Just feel I'm being pulled in
so many different directions.

731
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:41,633
You know, like teaching...

732
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:45,364
writing, chasing killers.

733
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:47,136
Everything okay with Andy?

734
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,300
Quite the reverse.

735
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:49,735
He couldn't be more supportive.

736
00:31:49,737 --> 00:31:51,870
Right, well, that's good.

737
00:31:51,872 --> 00:31:53,305
Well, how about this... this case...

738
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:54,973
the one with the missing heart?

739
00:31:56,677 --> 00:31:59,945
Imagine the type of person
who would have the idea

740
00:31:59,947 --> 00:32:03,115
to cut out another person's heart

741
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:05,032
and prepare for it...

742
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,686
and follow through with it.

743
00:32:07,688 --> 00:32:09,188
My.

744
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,156
You're enjoying this.

745
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:13,058
Relishing every second.

746
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,426
My goodness.

747
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:16,295
Welcome back.

748
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:17,793
The old Dylan has returned.

749
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,632
Yeah, but he's scaring me.

750
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:23,435
What if I can't stop?

751
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,263
_

752
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:30,875
Gotta go.

753
00:32:33,977 --> 00:32:35,247
Doesn't look like a boyfriend.

754
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:37,939
Watch. See him squeeze her head?

755
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:39,084
A pressure point?

756
00:32:39,086 --> 00:32:40,920
Look at her hand. It's shaking.

757
00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:42,828
And the-the jerking of her arms.

758
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,556
And then her body goes limp.

759
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:45,891
What could cause that to happen?

760
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:47,205
A seizure followed by paralysis?

761
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:49,951
Well, he must have injected her
with a neurotoxin, wh...

762
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,998
It wasn't a pressure point.

763
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,620
He stuck a needle in her hair.

764
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,926
Which is why the M.E. didn't
see the injection mark.

765
00:32:56,928 --> 00:32:59,371
I'm calling him, have him run
an advanced tox screen.

766
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:01,173
Maybe it wasn't a mistaken identity.

767
00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:02,441
Beth was a grifter.

768
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:04,810
Maybe it was meant to be her.

769
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:07,212
It's hard to tell from that
video if he knew her or not.

770
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:09,281
If he didn't, we can rule out pride.

771
00:33:09,283 --> 00:33:10,649
Which leaves greed and...

772
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:12,451
Come on. If you keep stating

773
00:33:12,453 --> 00:33:14,019
that “three motive” theory,

774
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:15,888
we can rule out intelligence, too.

775
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:18,123
What are we missing?

776
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,535
Take a seat right there.

777
00:33:19,537 --> 00:33:21,066
Hey, guys.

778
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:22,628
Ooh.

779
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,263
Pete, what happened?

780
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:28,133
This colossal guy just
shows up to my flower stand,

781
00:33:28,135 --> 00:33:31,203
and he just starts punching and punching.

782
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:33,171
He said that if I ever even look

783
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,552
at Maggie again, it'll be
the last thing I ever do.

784
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:37,476
Never thought I'd feel bad for a stalker.

785
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:39,144
Was the guy who hit you 50s,

786
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:40,412
thin, wearing a pinky ring?

787
00:33:40,414 --> 00:33:42,748
No, no, he was young and ripped and...

788
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,085
wearing my face on his fist.

789
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,418
Do you want to go to the E.R.?

790
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,253
With you?

791
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:50,956
Anthony, can you please get
Pete's story and a description?

792
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:53,292
- Sure.
- Detective Fucci will help you.

793
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,363
Frank might have had someone follow us,

794
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:00,232
and we led him to Pete.

795
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:03,602
Yeah, when your own child's
in danger, you'd do anything.

796
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,308
She's my only child.

797
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,410
Why didn't you tell me?
I would have handled it.

798
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:12,611
Thanks to my father.

799
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:13,812
He'd do anything for me.

800
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:15,547
That's why I didn't tell you.

801
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:18,050
There's nothing stronger.

802
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:20,252
Your “three motive” theory.

803
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:22,354
I know what we're missing.

804
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,489
Love.

805
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,492
The love of a parent.

806
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:38,592
- Okay, so why the dad?
- Love.

807
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:41,348
- Love?
- The love of a parent for their child

808
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,905
is the most powerful love there is.

809
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:44,974
And the best way to get back
at a guy like Frank,

810
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,809
who's devoted to his daughter,
is to go after her.

811
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:48,911
Somebody wanted Maggie
dead, and you don't get to be

812
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:51,681
as successful as Frank is
without making a few enemies.

813
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:53,416
So, revenge?

814
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:54,618
That's it?

815
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,387
Okay.

816
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:59,622
I was reviewing the bank
records of Denizen Solutions,

817
00:34:59,624 --> 00:35:01,357
Frank's company, which
is supposed to sell

818
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,326
medical supplies to hospitals,
but a lot of these checks

819
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:05,028
are made out to “Denizen Cares”...

820
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,496
Sounds like a charity.

821
00:35:06,498 --> 00:35:08,331
Yeah, or a front.

822
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,066
And look at this.

823
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:13,186
All the payments are made
using personal checks.

824
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:14,937
And they're not small amounts, either.

825
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:19,442
$225,000, $350,000... $400,000?

826
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:24,514
Could our medical supplies maven
be a money launderer, too?

827
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:26,115
If he is, he's not
very adept at hiding it.

828
00:35:26,117 --> 00:35:27,550
Or maybe he's a bookie.

829
00:35:27,552 --> 00:35:29,285
Yeah, but then the
checks would be clustered

830
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:31,454
around the same dates when
there are games or fights.

831
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,222
These checks are spread over time.

832
00:35:34,824 --> 00:35:36,526
What? I had a gambling phase.

833
00:35:36,528 --> 00:35:38,394
Thank you, guys. Thanks.

834
00:35:38,396 --> 00:35:40,229
None of these names look familiar.

835
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:42,530
Well, just try any of them.

836
00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:44,400
Charles Shore.

837
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:46,702
Fund-raiser was held for Charles Shore

838
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:48,504
because he needed a kidney.

839
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:51,007
Alison Dorfman.

840
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:53,409
She got a cornea transplant.

841
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:55,745
Wait, here's a check

842
00:35:55,747 --> 00:35:57,046
from Haru Onishi.

843
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:58,388
Isn't he the chef... Onishi Sushi,

844
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,925
where Frank eats?

845
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:02,418
Why would a sushi chef pay $250,000

846
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,986
to a medical supplies company?

847
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:06,022
Try the transplant registry.

848
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,326
Yup.

849
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:11,627
Riku Onishi.

850
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:13,830
She's got to be related to Haru Onishi.

851
00:36:13,832 --> 00:36:15,117
So, all the names of the people

852
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,166
who made payments to Denizen Cares

853
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:19,469
are also on the transplant list.

854
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:22,939
Frank is a black market organ broker,

855
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:25,274
and Onishi bought a
heart for his daughter.

856
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:27,959
Onishi's daughter died a month ago

857
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,283
of congestive heart disease.

858
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:30,623
She never got the transplant.

859
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,113
But Onishi paid Frank 250 grand.

860
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:35,237
And Frank returned that 250
on the same day

861
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,854
he got 350 from a Derek Wilson.

862
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:39,701
Frank sold the heart
to the highest bidder.

863
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:41,769
And Onishi's daughter died
waiting for one.

864
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:43,337
Sushi knives are built for precise cuts.

865
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:45,038
Onishi wanted revenge.

866
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
And to get back at Frank,
Onishi went after his daughter.

867
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:48,991
But he got Beth by mistake.
The cross-race effect.

868
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:50,577
But why would Frank go back there

869
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,010
after what he did to Onishi?

870
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:54,748
Frank saw Onishi as
commerce, not a person.

871
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,216
He got a better offer,

872
00:36:56,218 --> 00:36:58,051
gave Onishi back his
money. That was that.

873
00:36:58,053 --> 00:37:00,821
Why should business stop him
eating in his favorite place?

874
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:03,624
It's Friday, almost lunchtime.

875
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:06,059
If Maggie joins her dad and Onishi sees

876
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:07,895
- he didn't kill her...
- He may try now.

877
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:09,127
Come on.

878
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:12,633
Hey! Is your daughter here?

879
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:15,661
- She's in the bathroom. Why?
- Stay right there.

880
00:37:15,663 --> 00:37:17,374
Hey! Hey!

881
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,306
Where's your boss?

882
00:37:20,843 --> 00:37:23,477
Detective Needham?
Go back in and lock the door.

883
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,009
Who are you?

884
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,911
My name is Dylan Reinhart.

885
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:36,679
I'm with the NYPD.

886
00:37:38,016 --> 00:37:40,283
I'm not going to run.

887
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,833
I gave up everything to save my daughter.

888
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:51,294
I failed her.

889
00:37:52,764 --> 00:37:53,863
He's confessing.

890
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:55,098
He can do so while under arrest.

891
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,066
It's a deathbed confession.

892
00:37:58,236 --> 00:38:00,903
Is that blowfish you ingested?

893
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,467
That's what you injected
into the girl, isn't it?

894
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,825
Yes.

895
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:10,179
I didn't know it wasn't his daughter.

896
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:12,782
I never would have done it.

897
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:14,851
I can't tell you what it means

898
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:18,388
to lose the person
you love most in the world.

899
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:20,832
I'm calling an ambulance.

900
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,326
- There's no point.
- I'm calling just in case.

901
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:34,290
Frank Fallon gave hope to my daughter.

902
00:38:34,732 --> 00:38:36,465
To me.

903
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:39,776
Riku should be alive right now.

904
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,979
Every day, he comes in, smiling,

905
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:46,015
joking, eats my food

906
00:38:46,017 --> 00:38:47,417
like nothing's happened.

907
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:49,118
I wanted him to be

908
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,688
in pain the way I've been in pain.

909
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,360
But when his daughter came in today...

910
00:38:57,695 --> 00:38:59,895
You knew you'd killed the wrong girl.

911
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:04,967
After Riku died, that father...

912
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:08,771
his face haunted me in my mind.

913
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:14,009
What have I done?

914
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:24,987
I'm slammed.

915
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,089
Okay, I'll make this quick.

916
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:28,724
I didn't tell you what I was doing

917
00:39:28,726 --> 00:39:31,127
because the excitement I felt
chasing killers,

918
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:32,728
it-it... it scared me.

919
00:39:33,476 --> 00:39:36,466
I do need to do this kind of work,

920
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:39,202
but I'm going to need
your help to turn it off.

921
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:42,271
I can't do it without you.

922
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,461
But you know what?

923
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:45,086
I'm gonna need your help, Dylan,

924
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:46,843
trusting that sometimes I may know

925
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:47,944
more about behavior than you.

926
00:39:47,946 --> 00:39:49,675
At least your behavior.

927
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:52,181
'Cause, you know,
smart as you are, sometimes...

928
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,950
you can be really dumb.

929
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:55,318
Fine.

930
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,186
I think “dumb” is a bit much.

931
00:39:58,156 --> 00:39:59,455
Thanks.

932
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:01,491
Okay, I see you're busy.

933
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:02,658
Just go do what makes you happy.

934
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,820
Go make New York safe.

935
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:04,886
And, um...

936
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:06,562
thank you.

937
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:10,600
Almost forgot.

938
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:12,768
Saw this on the way in today.

939
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:28,784
I will try not to make fun of
your overly simplistic ideas.

940
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:30,353
And I'll try not to keep

941
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:31,888
reminding you that I'm your boss.

942
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,122
Even though I am.

943
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:34,457
And for the record,

944
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:36,893
Onishi was willing
to buy a black market heart.

945
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,361
Greed.

946
00:40:38,363 --> 00:40:40,129
He went after Maggie to avenge Frank.

947
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:41,631
Pride.

948
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:43,900
And he did it all
because he loved his daughter.

949
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,902
Greed, pride and love.

950
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:47,470
The trifecta.

951
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,210
Another collar.

952
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:55,645
You're making us look bad.

953
00:40:55,647 --> 00:40:56,970
You don't need our help with that.

954
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:59,782
Well, we're gonna go to Dis Con.
Want to come, celebrate?

955
00:40:59,784 --> 00:41:01,551
Come on, Lizzie. It'll be fun.

956
00:41:01,553 --> 00:41:02,919
Dis Con?

957
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,353
Short for Disorderly Conduct.

958
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:05,955
A cop bar. I'll pass.

959
00:41:05,957 --> 00:41:07,723
Big surprise.

960
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:08,992
Let's go.

961
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:11,527
You know, I'm starting
to think the hazing

962
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:12,929
was less about giving me a hard time

963
00:41:12,931 --> 00:41:15,258
and more about trying to cheer you up.

964
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,600
Maybe they want to see you
like you used to be.

965
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:19,095
I've always been like this.

966
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,437
I know you well enough
to know that's not true.

967
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:23,472
You should go out
for a drink with the guys.

968
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:24,740
I'll go with you.

969
00:41:24,742 --> 00:41:26,042
Maybe another time.

970
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:28,177
Right now, I just need to stay here.

971
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,445
Here?

972
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:30,646
On the sidewalk?

973
00:41:30,648 --> 00:41:32,582
- Yeah.
- Why?

974
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:37,219
Three, two, one.

975
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:39,522
What the hell did you do to my Harley?

976
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,798
Lizzie.

977
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:52,984
You can take my bike if you like.

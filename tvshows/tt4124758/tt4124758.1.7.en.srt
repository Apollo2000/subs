1
00:00:01,331 --> 00:00:03,733
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

2
00:00:03,757 --> 00:00:06,550
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

3
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,852
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

4
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:10,852
I became Professor Reinhart.

5
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,582
I wrote a book about abnormal behavior

6
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:14,857
and criminals, which was so successful

7
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:17,675
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

8
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:19,084
That's when the
New York Police Department

9
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,071
reached out to me to help catch him.

10
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:23,021
Which I did, so they hired me,

11
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:24,613
and I became Consultant Reinhart.

12
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,631
So now I'm working with this woman,

13
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,009
Detective Lizzie Needham

14
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,444
of the homicide division,
catching killers.

15
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:31,980
Looks like I need a new name.

16
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:34,393
Don't they call you Professor Psychopath?

17

18
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:53,788
Our ability to glide

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,064
from what society deems normal

20
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:58,115
to what we've defined as abnormal

21
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,325
is in part because we carry inside us

22
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,984
versions of ourselves
as the children we once were.

23
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:07,208
All it takes is the right person,

24
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:10,211
the right place or word

25
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:13,510
to cleave us open
and have that child emerge

26
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:17,462
in all its glorious joy,
selfishness and anger.

27
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:20,592
It can push us to do things
we normally would not,

28
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:22,444
and I'm not just talking about flossing.

29
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,769
A perfectly loving person

30
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,100
can become a heartless person,

31
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:31,310
given the right circumstances.

32
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,106
Any idea what's going on in there?

33
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,324
Nope.

34
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:47,302
Lieutenant's been in there
with her for a while.

35
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,238
Needham.

36
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,439
Okay.

37
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,044
Car seven's clear.

38
00:02:13,338 --> 00:02:15,236
ESU. Bomb Squad.

39
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:18,301
This isn't good.

40
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:09,024
We can rule out an accident.

41
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:24,282
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

42
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:32,279
We had an incident
on the R Train earlier today

43
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:34,115
with multiple fatalities.

44
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,027
We will be withholding the victims' names

45
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,719
until their next of kin
have been notified.

46
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,912
All I can say now is a poisonous gas

47
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:43,802
was released on that subway.

48
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:46,300
What exactly the gas was,
how it was released

49
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:49,728
and who released it
remain unknown at this time.

50
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:53,972
Conductor Johnson, I'm Detective Needham.

51
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,532
This is my partner, Dylan Reinhart.

52
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,101
Can you tell us what happened?

53
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,119
I've been on the R Train for nine years.

54
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:01,554
I've never seen anything like this ever.

55
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:02,978
Anything unusual happen?

56
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,137
I was held in the tunnel by dispatch.

57
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,082
- For how long?
- Almost five minutes.

58
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:09,671
Train ahead of us had a door malfunction.

59
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,407
Thank you. Get some rest.

60
00:04:13,282 --> 00:04:15,555
So, the passengers were between stations

61
00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:17,733
for around five times longer
than expected.

62
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:20,104
That's a lifetime when
you're inhaling toxic fumes.

63
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:22,410
There is no way the killer knew

64
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:23,851
that the train would have been delayed.

65
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:26,221
Unless the killer... or killers...
delayed the train.

66
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,944
Either way, the gas had
enough time to damage that pole.

67
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:31,946
Either way, everyone on that car
is indeed dead.

68
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:36,120
Maybe not everyone.

69
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:39,393
- Hey!
- Were you on that train?

70
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:40,638
Hey, hey. You okay?

71
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,917
Yeah.

72
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:44,199
I can smell the gas on his jacket.

73
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,589
Y-you shouldn't have that on you.

74
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,581
It's contaminated.

75
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,638
Can you take it off?

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,792
I'm good.

77
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,589
He's not a victim. He's a thief.

78
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,892
Turn around.

79
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:01,852
I haven't seen one of these

80
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:05,024
since I was a kid. I found that.

81
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,107
I found all of these.

82
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:07,132
Found?

83
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:09,118
Passengers drop crap all the time

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,335
when they're rushing to make their train.

85
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:11,713
Look, I'm not a bad guy.

86
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:13,250
I just... I work this line.

87
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,011
I-I grab things when I can.

88
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,000
You pick dead people's pockets.

89
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,465
Don't sell yourself short.

90
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,682
You sound like a wonderful guy.

91
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:21,348
What did you see down there?

92
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,302
I saw the bodies...

93
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:25,480
bunched in front of the doors.

94
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,824
The Walkman was just laying on
the ground not next to anybody,

95
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:29,817
so I took it.

96
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:31,578
And a phone from some guy's hand.

97
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,981
I mean, what was he
gonna do with it, you know?

98
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,519
Okay, come on.

99
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:37,377
Come on.

100
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,334
Any word on that phone
the pickpocket... picked?

101
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:48,608
Still waiting for it to be unlocked,

102
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,588
along with all the
other phones from that car.

103
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:51,868
Anything on the cassette in the Walkman?

104
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,341
The Walkman was broken,

105
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:55,103
and finding a working
cassette player around here

106
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,121
may be more challenging
than finding the killer.

107
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,947
If there was a specific target
on the train,

108
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:01,823
maybe the Walkman could give us
a clue as to why.

109
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,801
Or it could be a Duran Duran mix tape.

110
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:05,948
I happen to have a cassette deck at home.

111
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,518
In your boom box?

112
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,639
Yes, next to my eight-track.

113
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:10,913
- What's an eight-track?
- Ooh.

114
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:12,642
So, probably shouldn't ask
who Duran Duran are?

115
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:14,597
- No!
- Kidding.

116
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,166
My first Walkman changed my life.

117
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:21,273
I used to listen to music
on it all the time.

118
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,939
It was my escape.

119
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:24,829
Was your childhood really that bad?

120
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:27,683
My mother was busy taking care
of my father.

121
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:29,621
My father was busy
taking care of his work.

122
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:31,245
It's not like the bills weren't paid

123
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,295
or there was no food on the table.

124
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:36,562
Just, I had a cassette player
for my best friend.

125
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,160
Okay, listen up, everybody.

126
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:40,569
There were 12 victims
on the car, all adults.

127
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:43,691
Seven of the 12 were from out
of state, one French diplomat.

128
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,722
Still assessing the CCTV footage

129
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:47,388
from every stop on the line,

130
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,463
and no one has claimed
responsibility... yet.

131
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,545
This is being treated as a terrorist act,

132
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,467
so the FBI will take the lead.

133
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:57,225
We need to pull together
and sniff out those responsible

134
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,298
and show them and the rest of the world

135
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,348
no one gets to do this to us.

136
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,046
Let's get 'em.

137
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:09,068
No one claimed responsibility.

138
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:11,550
Terrorists need credit.

139
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:13,119
They usually aim for big, splashy targets

140
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:14,753
with high body counts,

141
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:16,963
yet this was the last car,
typically the least populated,

142
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,533
of a fairly quiet subway line,

143
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:20,231
not even at rush hour.

144
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:23,858
Would now be a bad time

145
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:25,385
to tell them it's not a terrorist attack?

146
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:27,304
They unlocked the
phone from the pickpocket.

147
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:29,440
Belongs to victim Josh Monaz.

148
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,330
Sent a text from the subway:

149
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,868
"Doors closed before I could get off.

150
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,205
Meet you at the usual place."

151
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,256
To a Grace Asher.

152
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:39,082
It's horrible.

153
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,562
He was an amazing man,
and we were soul mates.

154
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,891
May I ask why you didn't come forward?

155
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,947
Is it because you were

156
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:47,972
having an affair with the victim?

157
00:07:47,974 --> 00:07:50,150
Having an affair? With Josh?

158
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:52,072
You aren't wearing a wedding ring,

159
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,538
and all four male victims
were wearing one.

160
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,141
People who want to hide the truth

161
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,767
tend to gesture toward
themselves, as you have done;

162
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,433
Play with their hair, as you are doing;

163
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:02,451
And repeat the question
before answering it,

164
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:03,924
as you did when I asked you

165
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,686
if you were having an
affair with the victim.

166
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,704
And as Detective Needham mentioned,

167
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:09,914
you didn't come forward.

168
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:13,374
Josh is married,

169
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,135
but not happily.

170
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:17,354
We were going to a hotel,

171
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:19,249
and I didn't want anyone to find out.

172
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,112
What happened on the platform?

173
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:23,354
We were heading for the train,

174
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:25,853
and Josh was ahead of me.

175
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,544
And then, suddenly,
this guy appears on my left

176
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:30,593
and barrels into me as he passes.

177
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:31,746
He knocked my bag down.

178
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,605
All of my things went flying.

179
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:34,918
What did he look like?

180
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,192
He was skinny, white.

181
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:40,578
I call out to Josh,
but he's too far ahead.

182
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,331
I look up to see the guy.

183
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,613
He was wearing a backpack,

184
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:45,470
and he gets onto the same car as Josh.

185
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:48,257
Just as the doors are
about to close, he hops off

186
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:50,083
and then jumps onto another car.

187
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:54,023
J-Josh tries to hold the doors
open for me...

188
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,714
and...

189
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,501
I grab my things, but...

190
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:02,992
the doors slam shut,
and the train takes off, and...

191
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:05,740
that was the last time that I...

192
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,183
I'll never see him again.

193
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:10,400
Do you remember any more detail

194
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:12,289
about the guy who knocked into you?

195
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:16,760
He... he had a tattoo...

196
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,067
on his forearm.

197
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:20,362
It was just a blur,

198
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,975
but I think it was a leaf.

199
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,236
Like...

200
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,446
a marijuana leaf.

201
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:30,153
We are New Yorkers.

202
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,362
That is why our city
is open for business,

203
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,444
including the subway.

204
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:37,071
I will be taking the subway
back to city hall,

205
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:41,681
and I implore my fellow
New Yorkers to do the same.

206
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,819
That's the official public message,

207
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:46,350
but FBI and DHS are still on high alert.

208
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:49,360
French diplomat didn't have
any apparent enemies.

209
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:50,801
No one's standing down yet.

210
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:52,521
That cassette tape was just a long,

211
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,665
boring lecture about the
history of Central Park.

212
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,322
And the Olmstead Hotel.

213
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:58,233
Frederick Law Olmstead
served as the park's...

214
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,928
And turns out that victim's mistress

215
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,221
wasn't as much help with
the sketch artist as we'd hoped.

216
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:03,818
We struck out looking

217
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,865
for a matching marijuana tattoo
in the tattoo book.

218
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,915
Maybe the FBI had better luck with her.

219
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,541
Speaking of which, there's been
an operational shift overnight.

220
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,424
So, even though we apprehended
a thief and found an eyewitness,

221
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:15,025
we're being pushed aside?

222
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:17,492
The Joint Terrorism Task Force
is going to take the lead,

223
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:20,706
- linking with federal investigators.
- This is a huge case.

224
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,489
I want to catch
the son of a bitch who did this.

225
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:24,347
You know it's not my call.

226
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:27,593
Don't worry.

227
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,354
Very few terrorists have motives that are

228
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:32,205
psychologically complex
or individually nuanced.

229
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:34,448
Religious zealot, fascist militant...

230
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,466
pretty much the same guy.

231
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:37,939
How boring for you.

232
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,188
I do have something for you.

233
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,918
We thought it was
connected to the subway,

234
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,013
but given the negligible
size of the explosive,

235
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:44,179
we're ruling that out.

236
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,692
Yay. We get the negligible case.

237
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:47,152
There was a small explosion

238
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:49,003
at the Central Park Carousel...
one fatality.

239
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,316
It's yours.

240
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,698
There was an explosion around 8:30.

241
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,749
Threw this blue horse and
this guy into the air.

242
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,343
Found some explosives
in the carousel area,

243
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:02,137
and you got some eyewitnesses over there.

244
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:07,006
We were on our morning ride.

245
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:09,536
We got about a block north, and boom.

246
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,733
Kathy called 911.

247
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,058
I passed this.

248
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,083
I don't know if it belonged to the bomber

249
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:17,231
or if some kid lost it,

250
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:19,011
but I thought I'd grab it.

251
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,019
You should give him a medal.

252
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:22,879
He rushed in to save that guy's life.

253
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,368
I just did what any New Yorker would do.

254
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,049
And, anyway, it wasn't enough.

255
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,043
What's your name?

256
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,068
Kyle Adams.

257
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,023
Um, I had a father and son

258
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,811
in my carriage
when I heard the explosion.

259
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:36,114
I, I'm a hansom cab driver.

260
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:37,748
The last place a horse should be

261
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,895
is walking around the streets
of New York City.

262
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,003
Shame on you!

263
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:42,329
We treat our horses better

264
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,575
than most people treat their dogs.

265
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,661
Not to mention, we hit fewer
pedestrians than bicyclists.

266
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,037
If you both don't mind...

267
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,949
Please continue.

268
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,737
Um, I told them they'd have

269
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:55,061
to walk the rest of the way,
and I rushed to help the man.

270
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:57,272
- I was too late.
- Thank you.

271
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:58,938
You can all go.

272
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:01,243
Officer, can we get this to the lab?

273
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,134
- Absolutely.
- As soon as possible.

274
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:09,379
Dylan.

275
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:11,174
Roger.

276
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:13,155
CIA involved in this?

277
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:16,358
The Case of the Merry-Go-Round Murder?

278
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,703
Hardly.

279
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:20,073
I was called in for the subway incident.

280
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:22,059
That French diplomat who died...

281
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,461
he was DGSE, stationed in Tehran,

282
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:26,448
and he was under surveillance by us.

283
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,807
I understand Command Ops
took you off the main event.

284
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,560
I can get you reassigned,

285
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:34,443
stop you from wasting your time here.

286
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:36,684
In fact, I already made the call.

287
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:40,201
Hey, it's a big case.

288
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:42,155
- My car's waiting.
- No, thanks.

289
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:45,293
Well, figured it was worth a shot.

290
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:48,241
At least let me take you
and Andrew to dinner tonight.

291
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:50,323
I'll check in later.

292
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:51,796
You look pretty good.

293
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:54,359
Police work suits you.

294
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,766
Who's that?

295
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:02,591
That...

296
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:04,822
is my father.

297
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:15,436
The vic was Cyrus Bryant.
He was one of my Cis when I

298
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,021
was in narcotics. He'd been
cooperating for a while.

299
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,711
Cyrus had been involved in
the ongoing investigation

300
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,433
into two warring drug dealers
vying for uptown traffic.

301
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:26,142
Looks like he got hit and we lost a CI.

302
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,741
Wouldn't drug lords just shoot a rival?

303
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,391
Why cause a public spectacle
with an explosion?

304
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,630
There's a hole in the back
of this saddle.

305
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:37,340
Got something for you.

306
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:38,845
I love when this happens.

307
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,639
- When what happens?
- When I might be wrong.

308
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:41,920
It keeps me on my toes.

309
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,458
Maybe this is about drugs.

310
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,049
I give this burst
of humility about three seconds.

311
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:47,518
Except I don't think it is about drugs.

312
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,629
Ooh! Two seconds.

313
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:49,784
I mean, why use an explosive?

314
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:50,938
And such a small one. No.

315
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,532
Something else is going on.

316
00:13:54,328 --> 00:13:56,729
Don't be mad just because
I disagree with you.

317
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:58,042
You always disagree with me.

318
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,695
And I'm not mad. I'm frustrated.

319
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,897
We had a chance to get
back on the subway case.

320
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:03,754
You didn't even check
with me before saying no.

321
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,516
My father caught me off guard.

322
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,310
He loves to get in my head.

323
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:10,012
But he still came here to
offer it and to see you.

324
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,538
No, he came here because

325
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,235
a French diplomat died in the attack.

326
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:14,965
Maybe he came to the city for that.

327
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,016
Didn't he come to the park for you?

328
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:18,621
It's not that simple.

329
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,172
Never is with family.

330
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:22,591
Maybe you can explain it to me.
I'd like to know.

331
00:14:22,593 --> 00:14:25,347
I wrote a book, Freaks,

332
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:27,654
which was a best seller,
which got me in People magazine,

333
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:28,838
which you read three times.

334
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,152
I'm familiar with the book.

335
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:32,079
I'm not sure my father is.

336
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,983
I don't know if he ever read it.

337
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:36,494
So ask him.

338
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:38,736
I'm not sure I want to know the answer.

339
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:40,949
You shouldn't wonder.

340
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:42,775
Just ask. Take control.

341
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:45,402
If he hasn't read it, let him
know how much it bothers you.

342
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,082
It's not such a big deal.
It's just a book.

343
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,438
I'm gonna go and listen
to that cassette again,

344
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,873
see if I missed anything.

345
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,471
- Any leads on the subway case?
- Not that I've heard,

346
00:14:58,473 --> 00:15:00,833
but since I'm not on it, I wouldn't know.

347
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,682
Lizzie, we need your help
with Lieutenant Gooden.

348
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,206
- Why?
- Because you're her friend

349
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:05,437
and you never do anything wrong.

350
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,583
Yeah, you wouldn't stand
in a "ten items or less" line

351
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:09,857
- with 11 items.
- You're the ultimate rule follower.

352
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:11,457
Gee, thanks, guys.

353
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:12,420
What's wrong?

354
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:13,538
Lou has locked herself in

355
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,928
the conference room, closed the blinds

356
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,861
and said she is not to be disturbed.

357
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:19,141
- So don't disturb her.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

358
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,733
We need you to disturb her, all right?

359
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm this close to having a panic attack.

360
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:24,258
I've seen him have a panic
attack. It's not pretty.

361
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:25,730
Why is Lou talking to Internal Affairs?

362
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,268
Can you go in and find out?

363
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:32,164
Lizzie?

364
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,695
Fine.

365
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:42,055
Don't stand there. Move around.

366
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:50,583
I'm so sorry.

367
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,273
You look beautiful.

368
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:54,618
Thank you.

369
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,419
I just need a veil.

370
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:57,469
Lizzie, meet Olga.

371
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,582
- Olga, Lizzie.
- Hi.

372
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,582
I'm at work when the bridal shop opens,

373
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:03,490
and I'm still at work after it closes.

374
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:05,989
Olga was kind enough
to offer to do my fittings

375
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,655
in our conference room.

376
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:09,289
Everything okay?

377
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,114
Yeah. The guys just thought that you

378
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:12,684
were meeting with Internal Affairs again.

379
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:15,356
- Again?
- Yesterday.

380
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:18,375
Sally, she wasn't here

381
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,294
on, police business yesterday.

382
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:23,731
She's helping me plan my wedding.

383
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:27,888
Okay.

384
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,457
S-Sorry.

385
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:33,019
Wait, Sal... Sally?

386
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:35,929
Excuse me, Olga. Do you mind?

387
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:37,469
Can you just give us a minute, please?

388
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:38,529
Thanks.

389
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,258
You...

390
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,972
You asked Sally?

391
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,836
Because...

392
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,006
being on her third marriage,
she's got more experience?

393
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,327
You've been really swamped,
and you're doing great work.

394
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:54,555
We are always swamped.

395
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,807
I asked you to help with my wedding.

396
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,151
I know, but you just went on a date.

397
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:00,976
You're finally moving on.

398
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,322
Finally...

399
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:03,731
Okay, I get it.

400
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,845
Sorry that I've been a drag.

401
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:08,084
Lizzie, you haven't,

402
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:10,874
but you've had a rough time.

403
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:13,484
It's not even a year yet since...

404
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:16,017
You're afraid I'm too fragile?

405
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:19,092
I just didn't want to stir up
any more pain for you.

406
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:20,629
Your wedding should have come first.

407
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:22,968
It should have, but it didn't.

408
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,260
Yeah, you're right. I'm... I get it.

409
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,631
I'm sorry that I barged in on you.

410
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,841
That dress is gonna be perfect.

411
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,499
If you have a beer that costs

412
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:44,812
less than $20, I'll take it.

413
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,158
Otherwise, tap water is fine.

414
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,913
These prices are criminal.

415
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:49,941
Immoral. I would like a triple shot

416
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,982
of your finest tequila,
and could you bring it

417
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:53,743
as fast as humanly possible, please?

418
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,057
- Right away, sir.
- Thank you.

419
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:56,402
Wow.

420
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:58,035
You know when you, walk into a place

421
00:17:58,037 --> 00:17:59,957
or just see it and you
have a physical reaction?

422
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,559
Well, um, all this restaurant is to me

423
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,089
is a repository of
upsetting memories of dinners

424
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:05,858
- with my dear ol' dad.
- Come on, Dylan.

425
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,200
It's just... it's only dinner.

426
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,135
You're clearly forgetting

427
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:10,823
the last meal we had with my dad.

428
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,899
You told him you were leaving the CIA.

429
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:15,152
It's-it's... it's the only
thing he ever wanted for you.

430
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,545
The only thing he thought that
you both had in common.

431
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:19,436
Of course he wasn't gonna
react well to that news.

432
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:22,830
Well, he didn't have to be
so... him about it.

433
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,016
Tonight's gonna be different.

434
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:25,361
There'll be no bad news.

435
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:27,826
There'll be no news at all, and besides,

436
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:30,716
there is nothing your
father can say or do

437
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:33,081
that I can't help you handle.

438
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,804
- There you are.
- Thank you.

439
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:38,270
Except maybe that.

440
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:40,929
Welcome back, sir.

441
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:43,331
What is Lizzie doing here with him?

442
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:47,911
I invited Lizzie to join us, Dylan.

443
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:49,898
I thought it'd be nice to have

444
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,812
both of your partners together.

445
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:53,934
- Andrew.
- Roger.

446
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,014
Your father didn't tell you
he invited me.

447
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,836
Nope. He likes to withhold things.

448
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,047
Heard you gave up law and bought a bar.

449
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:03,033
Yes, I did. I...

450
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:05,691
I needed a less sleazy work environment.

451
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:10,609
Lizzie was just telling me
what it's like working with you.

452
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:12,556
I hope she didn't overuse
the word, "lackluster."

453
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,757
You don't have to answer any more

454
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,614
of my father's questions.

455
00:19:16,616 --> 00:19:18,216
My son is a big proponent of secrecy.

456
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:19,752
- It's genetic.
- Roger,

457
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:21,305
how long are you in town for?

458
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,462
Until we can close the terrorist attack.

459
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,315
It's not a terrorist attack.

460
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:26,864
Dylan likes to be a contrarian.

461
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:28,772
You mean I like to be right?

462
00:19:28,774 --> 00:19:32,333
Well, hop back on the case and prove it.

463
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:34,058
My offer still stands.

464
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,610
We have a case.

465
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,738
- You know that.
- Yes.

466
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:42,307
The Carnage on the Carousel.

467
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:43,812
Don't do this.

468
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:45,126
Come back.

469
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:48,457
Really?

470
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:51,371
That's why you're here?

471
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,774
Yes, this whole terrorist attack

472
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,634
is a ploy to get me to lure you back.

473
00:19:56,636 --> 00:19:58,381
It wasn't a terrorist attack.

474
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:02,086
Don't throw your calling away
on this nonsense.

475
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:04,490
Excuse me.

476
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:08,109
There's a fire at
the Olmstead Hotel and a body.

477
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:10,268
- Do you want to go check it out?
- Yes, I do.

478
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,169
Sorry to not eat and run,
but we have some nonsense

479
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,053
to attend to.

480
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:16,815
- I'm sorry.
- See you.

481
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,957
There's blood on the back of his head.

482
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,360
Maybe the fire was just a cover-up

483
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,994
for killing this guy.

484
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:56,811
They moved the chair and the couch.

485
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,614
Why go to the trouble
of rearranging the furniture,

486
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,343
ripping this place apart,

487
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:04,860
only to burn it down?

488
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,586
Maybe it's not about the body.

489
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:08,994
We're homicide cops.

490
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:11,229
It better be about the body.

491
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:14,333
People destroy things
because they've projected

492
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:15,998
their self-hatred onto something outside

493
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,953
which has to be annihilated.

494
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:19,137
No other vics?

495
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:20,867
No one else was found here? No kids?

496
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:22,020
No, just this guy.

497
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,526
So, why the kid's robe?

498
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,638
He destroys a room.

499
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:39,019
Destroys a carousel horse.

500
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:41,038
Kid's shoe.

501
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,312
Kid's robe.

502
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:48,744
Why do all this damage if you're
just gonna kill someone?

503
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:51,990
Whoever did this wanted
to destroy this place,

504
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:53,696
much like someone wanted to destroy

505
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:55,161
that blue carousel horse.

506
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:56,634
Victims may have been killed,

507
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:59,005
but I don't think that was the intention.

508
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,502
I think that horse and this room

509
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:03,393
were the actual targets,

510
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:06,276
and I think these crimes were
perpetrated by the same person,

511
00:22:06,277 --> 00:22:08,389
and I think he's only just started.

512
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:19,731
The man who rented out
the Olmstead Suite paid with

513
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:22,007
a stolen card. They don't
know who the victim was.

514
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:23,152
Judging from the footage we viewed,

515
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,915
the killer must have known his victim

516
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,751
and invited him in, but he was careful

517
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:28,656
to keep himself hidden from the cameras.

518
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,312
Could the vic have been in on it?

519
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,200
Maybe.

520
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,441
Possible but unlikely.

521
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:35,267
What I think is more likely is that

522
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:37,573
the killer was interrupted
by his visitor,

523
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:39,046
confronted about what he was doing,

524
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,224
and he had no choice but to silence him.

525
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,732
That's an awfully big leap

526
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:44,449
with zero evidence to support it.

527
00:22:44,474 --> 00:22:46,843
It is. But the room wasn't trashed

528
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:48,700
in the way a rock star trashes a room...

529
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,078
chaotic and haphazard.

530
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,303
There was a clear order
to how it was damaged,

531
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,673
and the furniture was rearranged

532
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:55,050
with a sense of logic.

533
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:56,396
The clock in the room

534
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:57,581
was damaged at 9:48.

535
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,671
That's when it stopped.

536
00:22:58,673 --> 00:23:00,432
The victim arrived at 9:55.

537
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:01,842
The only reason to destroy a room

538
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:03,123
in the way it was done

539
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,012
is if it had a personal meaning to him.

540
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:07,319
If he's internally fragmented,
he projects

541
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,944
all the bad stuff about himself
onto these places...

542
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:11,776
the carousel, the Olmstead room.

543
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,836
You're gonna have to get something
more concrete than that.

544
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:16,138
- Too negligible?
- Nice one, Lizzie.

545
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,739
How about the robe and the sneaker?

546
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:19,629
- Both kids' sizes.
- And the carousel.

547
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,230
All childlike stuff.

548
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:23,857
He could be the Doogie Howser
of murderers,

549
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:25,235
but he could also be an adult

550
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,413
who is destroying his own memories,

551
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:29,014
pieces of himself.

552
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:31,552
"The Doogie Howser of murderers."

553
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:33,687
Yeah, gonna need more than that.

554
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,251
Lizzie.

555
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:42,216
Is what happened with us
gonna be a problem for this?

556
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:43,721
Not for me.

557
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,964
It doesn't mean I've forgotten about it.

558
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,007
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

559
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,247
I'm sure you didn't mean to.

560
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,004
I should get back to work.

561
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:02,465
You know it's Lieutenant Gooden's job

562
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:04,451
to be unimaginative and irritating?

563
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:05,861
Yes.

564
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,031
She didn't ask me
to help plan her wedding.

565
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:10,761
She thought it'd be hard for you.

566
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:13,224
- Would it?
- Yes, but that's beside the point.

567
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:14,593
Let me make that choice.

568
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:16,642
Maybe she didn't want you to have to.

569
00:24:16,644 --> 00:24:19,973
Events, like places, can be
powder kegs for buried emotions.

570
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,447
Lieutenant Gooden was protecting you

571
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:23,598
from going through the
anguish of grief again.

572
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,230
Even if you know you have to move on,

573
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,662
it doesn't make it any easier.

574
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:28,706
For the record,
it's aggravating sometimes

575
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,770
how smart you are.

576
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,275
Tell me about it.

577
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:35,297
"Events, like places..."

578
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:37,083
What about 'em?

579
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,933
I think he was trying

580
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:43,470
to destroy his own bad memories,

581
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:44,877
but why now?

582
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,834
The tattoo.

583
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:48,916
The girl said the subway suspect

584
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,613
- had a tattoo.
- Yeah, like a marijuana plant.

585
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,504
What looks like cannabis
but isn't cannabis?

586
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:54,778
- I give up.
- A maple leaf.

587
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,412
What is Central Park's symbol?

588
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:57,885
Look how close they all are.

589
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:59,903
The carousel, the Olmstead, the subway.

590
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:02,882
This train leads right to the park.

591
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:05,634
All of these. It's the same guy.

592
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:07,448
What is he telling us?

593
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:11,409
The Walkman was damaged,
but maybe it wasn't from age.

594
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:14,223
Maybe it was from whatever
was released in that subway car.

595
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,990
Maybe the subway attack
wasn't meant to kill people.

596
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,945
Maybe they were just collateral damage.

597
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:19,867
Did the FBI ever share the compound

598
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:21,756
- that was found in that backpack?
- Nope.

599
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:23,678
But I know someone
who's still on the case.

600
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,991
He gave me his number

601
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:27,265
at dinner last night.

602
00:25:27,885 --> 00:25:29,284
I thought we consult each other first.

603
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:30,885
We do?

604
00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:36,651
So... you and your dad.

605
00:25:37,728 --> 00:25:40,260
You and me, we do this
because we can't turn it off.

606
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,500
It's who we are.

607
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:42,974
My father's the same way,

608
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:45,152
except in his mind, saving lives,

609
00:25:45,154 --> 00:25:47,522
protecting people, exists in a hierarchy.

610
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:50,982
The more people you save,
the more of a hero you are.

611
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,808
So being a cop isn't good enough?

612
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,242
Nothing I did ever was.

613
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:57,548
First of all, it was
my ability with music.

614
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,933
Then it was because I didn't
like girls the way he did.

615
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,820
Our relationship was like
a series of little threads.

616
00:26:03,822 --> 00:26:07,126
Each day, he'd pull one until who I was

617
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:10,076
had all these little holes.

618
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,483
I'm so sorry.

619
00:26:13,926 --> 00:26:15,847
True story.

620
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:18,634
Do you mind if I call him?

621
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:20,396
See what's in the backpack?

622
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,208
Thank you for asking.

623
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:32,207
Your father said the chemical

624
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,680
in the subway attack was chlorine.

625
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:35,666
A high concentration could be fatal

626
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:37,331
within a few minutes of exposure.

627
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,172
It's also a corrosive gas
that can destroy metal.

628
00:26:40,174 --> 00:26:42,505
He used chlorine
to damage the subway car.

629
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,553
The same way he destroyed
part of that carousel

630
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:45,642
and the hotel room.

631
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:46,956
Places.

632
00:26:46,957 --> 00:26:48,589
Had that train not stopped unexpectedly,

633
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,183
those subway riders
would probably have lived.

634
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:52,625
You happy now?

635
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:53,682
Why would I be happy?

636
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:54,900
You got your wish.

637
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:56,661
We're back on the subway case.

638
00:26:56,663 --> 00:26:57,802
So, this is weird.

639
00:26:57,804 --> 00:27:00,601
The vic in the hotel didn't die
from smoke inhalation.

640
00:27:00,603 --> 00:27:03,958
The signs point to blunt-force
trauma being the cause of death.

641
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:05,223
What's weird about that?

642
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:07,704
His blood panel showed
leptospirosis in his system.

643
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:09,421
What's weird about that?

644
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:11,239
Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection

645
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:13,166
that can infect people
who've come into contact

646
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,033
with cattle, pigs and horses.

647
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:18,095
There aren't too many cattle
or pigs in New York City.

648
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:19,312
- Horses!
- Horses!

649
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,021
We were told you're
friends with Kyle Adams.

650
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:25,045
Do you know him?

651
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:26,550
Kyle's not working today.

652
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:28,922
That's our horse, the blue one...
the one that was blown up.

653
00:27:28,923 --> 00:27:30,555
- Is that you?
- No.

654
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:32,637
This is Kyle's cab.
Why isn't he working today?

655
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:33,822
It's his birthday.

656
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:35,552
Do you know where he might be?

657
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,890
No, but he lives above the stables.

658
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,068
Police.

659
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,311
W-we need to talk to Kyle Adams.

660
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:46,464
I gave Kyle the day off.

661
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:48,123
Are any of your drivers missing?

662
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,518
Fritz.

663
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,229
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

664
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:52,262
Is he okay?

665
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:53,868
Is this Fritz?

666
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,281
My God.

667
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:57,147
What happened?

668
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:59,228
We're still piecing things together.

669
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:00,500
Does Kyle have any tattoos?

670
00:28:00,502 --> 00:28:02,839
On his forearm. A leaf.

671
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,334
We're gonna need to see Kyle's apartment.

672
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,442
Look at these.

673
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,726
The crime scenes.

674
00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:13,648
And I'll bet Kyle was at every one.

675
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:17,140
Terence Adams.

676
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:19,222
Kyle's father?

677
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:21,176
Why do I know that name?

678
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:28,267
Terence Adams led the restoration

679
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:29,676
of Central Park in the '80s.

680
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:31,855
That's whose voice was on the Walkman.

681
00:28:31,856 --> 00:28:33,680
Kyle's dad.

682
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:36,178
It didn't belong to a tourist.
It was Kyle's.

683
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,094
Explains Kyle's connection to the park.

684
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:41,758
The city thought
of Mr. Adams as a savior.

685
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,257
Seemed to have it all.

686
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:48,301
Until he committed suicide
28 years ago today.

687
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:49,868
That would explain why now.

688
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:54,180
He killed himself on Kyle's birthday.

689
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:57,167
It's the logic of someone
with arrested development.

690
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:58,535
He's thinking like a seven-year-old.

691
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,784
The Walkman,

692
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:01,995
the sneaker, the bathrobe.

693
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:04,429
They weren't just found at those scenes.

694
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:06,854
They were left there by Kyle.

695
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,593
Tributes.

696
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:11,092
Sacred last memories with his dad

697
00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:12,405
that now he's letting go.

698
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,846
It's a suicide mission.

699
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:15,384
Just like his dad

700
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,210
on the very same day,

701
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,964
at the very same age.

702
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:23,029
So that's that smell.

703
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,531
It's not horse dung.

704
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:25,749
It's lawn fertilizer.

705
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:29,016
With ammonium nitrate... the same thing

706
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,618
McVeigh used in Oklahoma City.

707
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,540
Kyle's planning something big.

708
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:33,949
The question is... where?

709
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:36,704
Did-did it say
where his father killed himself?

710
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:38,659
He jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge,

711
00:29:38,661 --> 00:29:40,294
but Kyle wasn't there to catch him.

712
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:43,002
That photo, with the bridge
in the background...

713
00:29:43,027 --> 00:29:44,115
his father's office.

714
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,716
It's my bet that Kyle will want

715
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:48,215
to destroy that memory, too,
and watch it being destroyed.

716
00:29:48,217 --> 00:29:50,981
We have to get to the bridge
before he blows it up.

717
00:29:57,627 --> 00:29:59,855
Set up a perimeter at Brooklyn Bridge.

718
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,693
Notify ESU and Bomb Squad.
Let all units know.

719
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,414
Stay off your portables
in Lower Manhattan.

720
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,604
Stay off your portables? Walkie-talkies?

721
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:08,105
Isn't that how the cops
talk to each other?

722
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,925
Radio waves could set off
a bomb and kill us.

723
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:12,683
- I'll find Bomb Squad.
- I'll look for Kyle.

724
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:16,623
I think I know where he may be.

725
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:23,285
What do we got?

726
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:26,329
Mobilization points set up
at Chambers and Cadman Plaza.

727
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:27,802
Okay.

728
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,369
Kyle!

729
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:35,915
I know you.

730
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,228
Yeah, we... met at the carousel

731
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,831
when you tried to save that man's life.

732
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:40,752
I know you're not a killer.

733
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:43,571
I know that wasn't part of your plan.

734
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:45,621
The carousel was bombed before it opened

735
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:47,383
to avoid casualties.

736
00:30:47,385 --> 00:30:49,241
The passengers would've lived

737
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:52,251
if the train hadn't
gotten stuck in that tunnel.

738
00:30:52,253 --> 00:30:55,504
Even killing Fritz
was an accident, wasn't it?

739
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,363
I-I didn't...

740
00:30:58,365 --> 00:30:59,644
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

741
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:01,309
Th-They were just in the wrong places.

742
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:02,399
I know.

743
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:04,961
Tell me about that last day,

744
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,204
what you did with your dad.

745
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:09,651
- Check the cars down that block.
- It's clear!

746
00:31:09,653 --> 00:31:11,977
Every car so far has been cleared.

747
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,388
It was your birthday.

748
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:22,609
My dad took off work for my birthday.

749
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,346
I wanted to spend it in New York City,

750
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:29,584
- do all the things...
- All the things

751
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:31,218
that any young kid from out of town

752
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,095
would want to do in the big city
on his birthday.

753
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:36,128
Ride the carousel. Stay in a fancy hotel.

754
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,329
Go on the subway.

755
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,315
No, I wanted to walk across
the Brooklyn Bridge.

756
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,621
He didn't.

757
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,831
It was late.

758
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,457
I threw a tantrum. He took me.

759
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:50,052
He did everything for me.

760
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:53,832
He... he was the greatest man I ever met.

761
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:57,853
But then later he went back there.

762
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,851
He said good night to me at the hotel.

763
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:03,169
Said he had to go back to the office.

764
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,929
- It's right downstairs.
- Yeah, I know.

765
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,435
I-I could never grow up

766
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:08,421
to be the man he wanted me to be.

767
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:10,370
Yeah, he was a great man.

768
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,866
And he wanted you to have a great day.

769
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:17,454
But at the end of it, he killed himself.

770
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,201
And you know what?

771
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:23,750
None of that, no matter what
your mind tells you...

772
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,791
none of that was your fault.

773
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:28,258
- It was.
- I know that you believe

774
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,237
you are destined to become like
your father, but you are not.

775
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:35,529
You are not like your father,

776
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:37,163
and you never will be.

777
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,751
Who are you?

778
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:42,320
My name's Dylan.

779
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:44,178
Get ready to see something, Dylan.

780
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,588
If you press that button,

781
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,381
it won't be just your memory
that you destroy...

782
00:32:48,408 --> 00:32:49,592
or the bridge.

783
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:51,257
Hundreds of people...

784
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:53,980
out for a walk, going to work...

785
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:56,414
This one's clear, too!

786
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:01,559
There! That's it!

787
00:33:01,584 --> 00:33:03,304
- Let's go. Over there.
- The horse trailer!

788
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:06,676
People who love this city,

789
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:08,982
who love the park.

790
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:11,289
Fathers and sons.

791
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,954
And you know what?

792
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:15,900
Some of them might be
spending a birthday together.

793
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:18,879
Do you really want to kill them?

794
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:21,558
That is not who you are, Kyle.

795
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,535
I know it's not.

796
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,668
Kyle, no!

797
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,853
Everyone's safe.

798
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,968
The bomb's defused.

799
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,794
- You did well.
- So did you.

800
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:06,932
Had Kyle pulled that detonator...

801
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:08,470
I could have saved him.

802
00:34:08,472 --> 00:34:10,071
He's a mass killer.

803
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:11,993
Losing a parent to suicide
at an early age

804
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:14,492
can often be a catalyst
for psychiatric disorders.

805
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:16,445
That is no excuse for what he did.

806
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:18,838
I know. The worst thing is...

807
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,635
he thought his father's
suicide was his fault,

808
00:34:21,637 --> 00:34:24,646
that he had made his father jump.

809
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,696
He was ill, damaged,

810
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,426
just like his dad.

811
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:31,773
But he spent his whole life

812
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,960
believing he had failed him,

813
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:38,417
and he just couldn't move on from that.

814
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:40,790
Moving on isn't always so easy.

815
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,385
Hasn't been for me.

816
00:34:43,387 --> 00:34:44,858
It wasn't for Kyle,

817
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,421
and look at all the damage it did.

818
00:34:47,422 --> 00:34:51,200
A dad commits suicide
on his son's birthday.

819
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,834
I think the father's the one
who failed the son.

820
00:34:56,604 --> 00:34:58,333
I heard that can happen.

821
00:34:58,335 --> 00:34:59,742
True story.

822
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:15,088
Need some help?

823
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,232
Piece of cake.

824
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:17,770
Okay...

825
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:19,532
Okay.

826
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,162
Maybe it can now be
your something borrowed,

827
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,073
except you never have to give it back.

828
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:26,619
My veil.

829
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,038
What is that, the world's biggest veil?

830
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,429
It's got my dress in there, too.

831
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,318
Promise, if you hate it, you'll tell me.

832
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,888
I'm gonna love it.

833
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,693
You know, I went with you to
ten different bridal shops,

834
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,943
then you change your mind
at the last minute

835
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,263
and buy something on your own?

836
00:35:39,265 --> 00:35:42,374
I was full of surprises... then.

837
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:44,918
It would have been...

838
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,042
I should have asked you
to help me with my wedding.

839
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:52,156
And I get why you didn't.

840
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:53,982
You sure about this?

841
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,057
It's been down there
gathering dust and self-pity.

842
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:59,010
Time for it and me to move on,

843
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:01,637
and I'm glad it'll finally
see the light of day.

844
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:05,766
You and Dylan saved the
day and a lot of lives.

845
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,878
Proud of you.

846
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,383
Thanks, boss.

847
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,836
What? What's wrong?

848
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:13,861
What?

849
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,975
Um...

850
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:18,057
- I hate this veil.
- What?

851
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:21,791
It is the single most
stomach-turning thing

852
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:24,090
- I've ever seen, and I work in homicide.
- That...

853
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:26,653
No, no, no, that is not
my dress or my veil.

854
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,343
Thank God.

855
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:31,874
The shop must have sent me the wrong one.

856
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:35,366
I just never realized it,
'cause I never opened the box.

857
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,853
My God.

858
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:38,729
I could play Aladdin.

859
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:40,299
I love it.

860
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:42,317
I'm wearing that to your wedding.

861
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:48,179
Very nice of you to see me off.

862
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:50,901
I don't get the chance too often,

863
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:53,559
and I do have my own agenda.

864
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,475
My book came out in paperback this week.

865
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,120
Never mind.

866
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:03,394
If you're trying to get
me to support your sales,

867
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:08,013
I'm happy to purchase it, but
I already own the hardcover.

868
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:09,480
Freaks.

869
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,055
A worthy effort.

870
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:14,233
What do they say?

871
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:17,789
"Everyone has one book in them""

872
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:20,398
I did recognize myself in there.

873
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,121
Something about Mother's cancer

874
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:25,963
and how a loving person
can still be heartless.

875
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,337
I meant it.

876
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,982
Thank you for calling me a loving person.

877
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:34,069
The life chose me,

878
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:39,381
and those who are lucky
to be chosen for this

879
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,175
are meant to abide.

880
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,706
I'm not making that choice.

881
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:47,062
Don't turn your back on
your gift to spite me.

882
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,293
You've always embraced your true self.

883
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:53,116
It's who you are whether
you accept it or not.

884
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:58,273
Dad, it's who I am whether
you accept it or not.

885
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:00,612
I once said those same words to you,

886
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:03,015
just in a different context.

887
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:07,339
You weren't raised
to think it's okay to quit,

888
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:09,037
to be a failure.

889
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,803
You cannot turn your back
on your responsibility

890
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:14,468
for a relationship.

891
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,839
I'm proud of who I am.

892
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:19,841
Yes, I loved my work at the Agency.

893
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:23,237
It was a fascinating,
thrilling, fulfilling life,

894
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,837
if sometimes immoral,

895
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,776
but when I met Andy,
I realized I knew nothing

896
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:29,353
about a fulfilling life.

897
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:31,599
That's been his gift to me.

898
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,897
I got where I am,
I've done what I've done,

899
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:36,948
because I've learned to sacrifice.

900
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,286
I'm not you.

901
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:42,393
You're a better case officer
than I ever was.

902
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:44,909
More clever, more defiant.

903
00:38:44,911 --> 00:38:46,574
If I had your abilities,

904
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:48,561
I never would have gone
into administration.

905
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:52,692
You were the case officer
I always wanted to be.

906
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:01,010
I should go.

907
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:04,341
Have a safe trip.

908
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:31,124
How'd it go?

909
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:34,661
Somehow... not bad.

910
00:39:41,848 --> 00:39:43,223
Thank you.

911
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:45,017
For what?

912
00:39:45,018 --> 00:39:46,446
For being you.

913
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,281
